[00:00.000 --> 00:06.840]  Make your next vacation unforgettable on Royal Caribbean's newest ship, Star of the Seas.
[00:07.000 --> 00:10.780]  It's everything you've loved about every family vacation you've ever been on,
[00:10.960 --> 00:14.180]  with mind-blowing thrills at the largest water park at sea,
[00:14.520 --> 00:19.520]  seven onboard pools for every level of chill, more than 40 ways to dine and drink,
[00:19.680 --> 00:24.280]  and even more to enjoy at our award-winning private island, Perfect Day at Coco Cay.
[00:24.280 --> 00:29.160]  This is the new Star of the Seas. Click or tap the banner to find out more.
[00:29.880 --> 00:35.560]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is number 30.
[00:35.700 --> 00:39.540]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey,
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.880]  Nick Schwartz, and Eric Baddour, in that order. Hello.
[00:44.660 --> 00:52.680]  Would you rather have you be given $50,000, right? Or you just have to click a mouse
[00:53.160 --> 00:56.020]  and however many times you click, you get that many dollars?
[00:56.300 --> 01:00.760]  Click a mouse. But if you leave more than a second between clicks, it ends?
[01:01.340 --> 01:05.600]  Click a mouse. I'll take the 50 grand, now that I think about it.
[01:05.600 --> 01:06.920]  Yeah, money, money, money! Click a mouse.
[01:06.920 --> 01:12.180]  Andrew thinks he can click continuously 50,000 times without a second in between.
[01:12.760 --> 01:13.960]  Easily. Oh, wow.
[01:14.140 --> 01:15.680]  Easily? Easily, yeah.
[01:16.400 --> 01:20.340]  But then at least he can just keep going. I'll do a stopwatch and a clicker.
[01:20.340 --> 01:22.580]  There has to be a thing that counts your clicks.
[01:22.740 --> 01:24.200]  Sounds good. Let's do it right now.
[01:24.480 --> 01:25.680]  No, I'm not doing it right now.
[01:25.860 --> 01:27.460]  Yep. No, you're doing it right now. Hang on.
[01:27.640 --> 01:32.220]  Do you think you could do it as fast as you could write down 20,000 things?
[01:32.680 --> 01:33.820]  What do you mean? No.
[01:34.340 --> 01:37.720]  Because you have number confidence. You have 5-digit number confidence.
[01:37.920 --> 01:39.520]  I do. Yeah, that's a great...
[01:39.520 --> 01:43.480]  I think a finger gets tired after 10,000 clicks.
[01:43.940 --> 01:47.480]  I'm imagining clicking 1,000 times, just clicking only.
[01:48.020 --> 01:49.820]  And I'm sure I'm going to get pretty tired around 1,000.
[01:49.820 --> 01:51.580]  Yep. All right. Are you ready, Andrew?
[01:51.740 --> 01:53.260]  We're going to see how long it takes in...
[01:54.060 --> 01:56.000]  What do we want to say? A minute or 30 seconds?
[01:56.060 --> 01:57.320]  How many times do we want to have him click?
[01:57.640 --> 01:59.140]  Is there a website that counts clicks?
[01:59.500 --> 02:01.860]  I've just put it into the chat.
[02:02.820 --> 02:04.560]  Let's do 60 seconds.
[02:04.920 --> 02:06.520]  60 seconds it is.
[02:09.460 --> 02:12.040]  Okay, let me get this here.
[02:12.880 --> 02:13.880]  Set this up here.
[02:14.020 --> 02:16.940]  60 seconds on the clock. Andrew, let me know when you're ready.
[02:17.320 --> 02:19.260]  Okay, one sec. Let me open it up.
[02:20.080 --> 02:21.560]  Okay. Okay, ready?
[02:21.940 --> 02:23.860]  Yep. Do you guys want me to share the
[02:23.860 --> 02:25.800]  time screen or does it matter to you?
[02:25.820 --> 02:27.220]  I think Andrew should share his screen.
[02:28.360 --> 02:29.000]  I can't.
[02:29.700 --> 02:34.020]  I was going to say we're going to be asking for the world if that was the case.
[02:34.100 --> 02:34.860]  There's just no way.
[02:35.220 --> 02:37.460]  I can. No, no. Here, here. I can share it.
[02:37.480 --> 02:38.780]  I can share it. It's fine. I'll do it on this.
[02:38.860 --> 02:40.000]  This is not my ideal click.
[02:42.040 --> 02:43.460]  It's not a good clicker.
[02:43.700 --> 02:46.500]  Just making sure we got the excuses already laid in.
[02:46.700 --> 02:49.320]  No, it's a touchpad and it's not my ideal click.
[02:49.820 --> 02:50.800]  You can plug a mouse in.
[02:51.260 --> 02:52.680]  Oh, let me adjust a little bit.
[02:53.080 --> 02:54.700]  Yeah, yeah. No, get comfortable.
[02:55.440 --> 02:58.280]  We're going to see how many clicks you can get in a minute.
[02:58.860 --> 03:00.540]  Let me know when you're ready.
[03:02.020 --> 03:03.340]  Okay, I'll do it countdown.
[03:04.060 --> 03:04.420]  Okay.
[03:04.980 --> 03:06.200]  Wait, hang on. Hang on.
[03:06.420 --> 03:07.880]  Now, am I doing it on go?
[03:07.940 --> 03:09.100]  You say three, two, one, go?
[03:09.420 --> 03:10.020]  Go. Yeah.
[03:10.180 --> 03:11.240]  Okay. Okay. Okay.
[03:11.440 --> 03:13.700]  I've got questions for you after we're done here, by the way.
[03:15.060 --> 03:15.420]  Okay.
[03:16.200 --> 03:16.660]  Good luck.
[03:17.140 --> 03:17.480]  Okay.
[03:18.860 --> 03:21.660]  Three, two, one, go.
[03:22.440 --> 03:23.260]  Okay, 60 seconds.
[03:23.260 --> 03:24.000]  I'm clicking, nothing's happening.
[03:24.380 --> 03:25.180]  I'm clicking, nothing's happening.
[03:25.280 --> 03:26.260]  I'm watching it.
[03:26.520 --> 03:27.960]  So far, dude, you should have just had...
[03:27.960 --> 03:29.020]  Well, click the plus, idiot.
[03:31.640 --> 03:33.440]  You can't be this dumb.
[03:33.700 --> 03:34.000]  It's impossible.
[03:34.000 --> 03:34.860]  Zero dollars.
[03:35.420 --> 03:36.680]  You got zero dollars.
[03:37.800 --> 03:38.980]  Do you see the plus button?
[03:39.300 --> 03:42.100]  Yeah, it says click plus button or space to count.
[03:42.220 --> 03:43.640]  So I was hitting space and it wasn't working.
[03:43.780 --> 03:45.020]  I don't want to hit fucking...
[03:45.020 --> 03:45.360]  Okay, here we go.
[03:45.360 --> 03:46.440]  I think it means space bar.
[03:47.480 --> 03:48.400]  I was trying to use the space bar.
[03:50.080 --> 03:53.120]  The whole thing was based on how many times could you click a mouse.
[03:53.460 --> 03:53.480]  Yeah.
[03:53.740 --> 03:54.520]  Okay, but it's hitting a button.
[03:54.680 --> 03:54.980]  It's close.
[03:55.260 --> 03:55.780]  Okay, here we go.
[03:56.020 --> 03:56.140]  Space bar.
[03:56.740 --> 03:57.260]  Wait, hang on.
[03:57.340 --> 03:57.800]  I'm already...
[03:57.800 --> 03:58.360]  My time...
[03:58.360 --> 03:59.460]  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[03:59.600 --> 04:00.480]  30 seconds?
[04:00.580 --> 04:01.080]  Like, what is this?
[04:01.080 --> 04:02.080]  Five, four...
[04:02.080 --> 04:02.540]  Hang on.
[04:04.360 --> 04:05.160]  Jesus Christ.
[04:05.300 --> 04:12.000]  Five, four, three, two, one, go.
[04:12.820 --> 04:14.180]  Oh, you already made 10 bucks.
[04:14.580 --> 04:14.660]  Oh.
[04:15.700 --> 04:16.800]  There's a giant...
[04:16.800 --> 04:21.040]  There's a giant green button he could be pressing on and he chose the smallest thing.
[04:21.900 --> 04:23.380]  Oh, he's already made 60 bucks.
[04:23.820 --> 04:24.020]  Yeah.
[04:24.460 --> 04:26.740]  See, yeah, in my head, I was thinking about this scenario and I was like,
[04:26.780 --> 04:28.600]  I could easily click over 50,000 times.
[04:28.880 --> 04:31.800]  And then I started imagining myself doing it.
[04:31.820 --> 04:33.220]  I was like, oh, there's no way I wouldn't get close.
[04:33.700 --> 04:36.380]  You would get so bored with the activity.
[04:36.920 --> 04:37.800]  But I was...
[04:37.800 --> 04:38.660]  I feel like if you...
[04:38.660 --> 04:41.380]  If there was a dollar sign in front of it, would you be as bored?
[04:42.060 --> 04:43.460]  No, you wouldn't be as bored.
[04:44.460 --> 04:47.000]  But Andrew could almost buy an Xbox at this point.
[04:47.700 --> 04:51.100]  Or he could have $50,000 and buy a lot of Xboxes immediately.
[04:51.900 --> 04:52.120]  Yeah.
[04:52.360 --> 04:53.740]  20 seconds, Andrew, keep going.
[04:54.480 --> 04:55.420]  Andrew, how are you feeling, son?
[04:56.200 --> 04:58.000]  Neck is cramping a little bit.
[04:58.080 --> 05:00.280]  Not an ideal position using a click pad.
[05:00.760 --> 05:02.800]  A lot of negative factors to this, but...
[05:04.080 --> 05:11.760]  Seven seconds, six, five, four, three, two, one, hands off.
[05:11.760 --> 05:13.400]  Wow, exactly 400.
[05:13.640 --> 05:22.980]  So 400 divided by, what, 50,000 would be how many minutes you'd have to do this at that speed?
[05:23.300 --> 05:23.480]  Yeah.
[05:23.600 --> 05:24.600]  Go in full tilt.
[05:25.320 --> 05:27.700]  All right, well, I guess somebody better do that math.
[05:29.620 --> 05:30.060]  125.
[05:31.520 --> 05:32.400]  125 minutes?
[05:32.420 --> 05:32.780]  I thought two hours.
[05:33.060 --> 05:35.040]  Yeah, two hours, a little over two hours.
[05:35.660 --> 05:36.860]  That's not bad, actually.
[05:37.060 --> 05:38.360]  That's not bad.
[05:38.620 --> 05:41.180]  I was thinking it was going to be more like 10 hours.
[05:41.180 --> 05:44.340]  So about 40 seconds in, he was like, oh, my neck's cramping.
[05:44.580 --> 05:46.320]  Yeah, because it's not an ideal position.
[05:46.520 --> 05:48.640]  If I could optimally do this, no problem.
[05:49.140 --> 05:49.320]  Yeah.
[05:49.500 --> 05:51.640]  If you just take one second off, though, it ends.
[05:51.660 --> 05:55.380]  So it's like you need to be ready to swap fingers, maybe.
[05:55.660 --> 05:56.640]  A second is longer than you think.
[05:57.160 --> 05:57.340]  Yeah?
[05:57.800 --> 05:58.080]  Yeah.
[05:58.520 --> 05:59.300]  One Mississippi.
[06:00.220 --> 06:00.740]  It was that long.
[06:00.800 --> 06:01.480]  It's a lot longer than I thought.
[06:01.600 --> 06:02.680]  That was way longer than I thought.
[06:02.820 --> 06:03.040]  Slow down.
[06:03.100 --> 06:03.320]  Whoa.
[06:04.920 --> 06:07.180]  Also the name of a great J-Trix album, One Mississippi.
[06:07.180 --> 06:07.740]  Oh!
[06:09.620 --> 06:11.280]  So has that changed your mind, Andrew?
[06:11.340 --> 06:11.920]  Are you still going to go?
[06:12.020 --> 06:13.660]  No, I would still absolutely click.
[06:13.960 --> 06:14.720]  OK, interesting.
[06:15.060 --> 06:16.580]  I'm definitely taking the $50,000.
[06:17.180 --> 06:21.840]  I think you hit a wall before the $50,000, but as soon as you pass the $50,000, I think it's just
[06:21.840 --> 06:23.320]  everything opens up.
[06:23.780 --> 06:24.620]  It's just exciting.
[06:25.120 --> 06:34.260]  I just think about how I can get $50,000 for free, or I have to do that amount of work to
[06:34.260 --> 06:38.380]  get $50,000 to then hope to get more, and everything has to go right.
[06:38.480 --> 06:44.120]  It just seems like $50,000 in the hand is worth $250,000 in the bush.
[06:45.320 --> 06:45.940]  That's fair.
[06:47.540 --> 06:50.620]  Yeah, I guess, you know, maybe I'd reconsider.
[06:51.260 --> 06:51.940]  I don't know.
[06:52.320 --> 06:53.380]  I think I could do more.
[06:54.080 --> 06:54.880]  I think I could do it.
[06:55.200 --> 07:01.340]  Well, if anybody out there has $50,000 and wants to challenge Andrew to do this,
[07:01.460 --> 07:02.620]  please send us an email.
[07:04.840 --> 07:06.500]  Uh, I have a question for Gavin.
[07:07.160 --> 07:07.500]  Okay.
[07:08.180 --> 07:11.220]  When you dream, do people talk?
[07:11.960 --> 07:13.700]  Do people talk in my dream?
[07:14.000 --> 07:17.060]  Yeah, because you don't have an inner voice, right?
[07:17.080 --> 07:18.120]  Like we talked about that before.
[07:19.000 --> 07:19.840]  I think...
[07:19.840 --> 07:22.360]  I'm curious, when you sleep, do you have an inner voice?
[07:23.340 --> 07:24.280]  That's such a good question.
[07:25.180 --> 07:28.060]  I mean, I've had conversations, but was anyone actually talking?
[07:29.740 --> 07:30.420]  What do you mean?
[07:30.440 --> 07:31.380]  Was I talking?
[07:31.640 --> 07:33.800]  Or were we just telepathically communicating?
[07:33.800 --> 07:35.160]  I think people have...
[07:35.160 --> 07:36.680]  I think people talk to me in dreams.
[07:37.260 --> 07:37.740]  Interesting.
[07:38.400 --> 07:38.880]  Interesting.
[07:39.240 --> 07:43.560]  I'm not sure I would get all the motivation I need without knowing what they're saying.
[07:44.220 --> 07:45.620]  Can you hear...
[07:45.620 --> 07:50.040]  Like, I know you don't have an internal monologue, but if you just wanted to right now,
[07:50.100 --> 07:54.120]  could you call up and hear my voice or Meg's voice in your head?
[07:54.920 --> 07:56.960]  Like, can you hear Meg speaking to you right now if you try?
[07:57.540 --> 07:57.820]  Yeah.
[07:58.300 --> 07:58.520]  Okay.
[07:59.120 --> 08:01.500]  Then I would assume you hear voices in your dreams.
[08:01.980 --> 08:02.780]  That's a good point.
[08:02.780 --> 08:04.040]  I was just curious.
[08:04.180 --> 08:04.800]  I was thinking about it.
[08:05.020 --> 08:05.620]  Random thought.
[08:06.180 --> 08:06.420]  Yeah.
[08:06.940 --> 08:11.540]  You don't have an inner voice, but like in your dreams, you're a chatty son of a bitch.
[08:12.600 --> 08:13.940]  You get it all out there.
[08:14.580 --> 08:17.200]  Maybe it's just my personality suppressing my subconscious.
[08:17.460 --> 08:21.800]  Maybe I want to be thinking and having a monologue and I'm suppressing it somehow.
[08:22.580 --> 08:23.480]  That's interesting.
[08:23.940 --> 08:24.660]  That is interesting.
[08:25.300 --> 08:31.320]  Speaking of sleep and random thoughts, I actually wrote down...
[08:31.320 --> 08:34.340]  I had my first thought of the day and I actually wrote it down today because it was a thought.
[08:35.040 --> 08:38.220]  And it doesn't make any sense, but it did when I wrote it down.
[08:38.580 --> 08:40.600]  It's one of those ones where I wrote it down and it made perfect sense.
[08:40.680 --> 08:43.820]  And then a couple hours later, I was doing my notes and it took me a while to figure
[08:43.820 --> 08:44.800]  out what I was even talking about.
[08:45.040 --> 08:46.520]  I have one of these when you're finished.
[08:46.780 --> 08:47.020]  Okay.
[08:47.240 --> 08:50.920]  The very first thought I had when I woke up this morning was,
[08:51.240 --> 08:55.940]  what if when a major league baseball pitcher dies and he goes to the gates of heaven to be
[08:55.940 --> 09:02.220]  let in and he has to talk to St. Peter, the rule is you have to get hit by every pitch you threw
[09:02.220 --> 09:03.860]  at a batter in your career.
[09:04.100 --> 09:07.980]  And St. Peter stands there with a pitching machine and just fucking wails you as many
[09:07.980 --> 09:09.160]  times as you hit batters.
[09:09.160 --> 09:10.380]  So if you're Roger Clemens, you're fucked.
[09:10.960 --> 09:14.500]  You know, if you know Orion, you had a long career, you're going to take a lot of hits.
[09:14.740 --> 09:17.700]  But, you know, if you were a relief pitcher, you're probably okay.
[09:18.300 --> 09:21.080]  That's such an interesting thought, like how different that would be for different people.
[09:21.500 --> 09:21.720]  Yeah.
[09:21.980 --> 09:23.940]  I don't know why I had that thought, but I did.
[09:24.660 --> 09:25.120]  What's yours?
[09:25.680 --> 09:26.980]  What was my first thought of the day?
[09:27.520 --> 09:27.620]  Yeah.
[09:28.120 --> 09:36.100]  Uh, I woke up and thought, um, what if I started using Y-O-U apostrophe R-E for you are,
[09:36.220 --> 09:37.800]  but in the wrong place.
[09:39.240 --> 09:45.080]  So what if I, so what if instead of saying like, there you are, I wrote that.
[09:46.740 --> 09:47.700]  Oh God.
[09:47.840 --> 09:51.360]  Cause I think like that, that is a correct apostrophe use,
[09:51.440 --> 09:53.100]  but it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
[09:56.160 --> 09:57.560]  That was your first thought?
[09:57.860 --> 10:01.240]  You just found the one hole in the English language.
[10:01.860 --> 10:03.220]  That's so fucking funny.
[10:03.220 --> 10:08.180]  I just, I just looked at there you're, I just started laughing.
[10:08.420 --> 10:10.380]  I woke up and I typed it to my phone.
[10:10.440 --> 10:13.180]  I was like, that's stupid, that's really dumb.
[10:15.060 --> 10:15.960]  That's awesome.
[10:17.340 --> 10:21.720]  Don't know where it came from, but I'm going to start using that.
[10:22.020 --> 10:22.720]  That's great.
[10:23.840 --> 10:24.520]  God damn.
[10:24.600 --> 10:27.940]  Yeah, that, that is a menacing, not even, you're a menace for using it.
[10:28.220 --> 10:28.980]  That's terrible.
[10:30.260 --> 10:31.960]  There you are, here you are.
[10:31.980 --> 10:32.520]  There you are.
[10:33.840 --> 10:36.420]  Did, uh, we put out our throat goat video, right?
[10:37.080 --> 10:37.480]  Yes.
[10:37.660 --> 10:38.000]  Yes.
[10:38.380 --> 10:40.100]  I saw a comment on it.
[10:40.200 --> 10:41.500]  I think it was on the Patreon.
[10:41.620 --> 10:43.720]  I should have wrote down who said it cause it was really funny, but I didn't.
[10:44.160 --> 10:48.520]  Uh, but somebody wrote down, get ready for the throat down.
[10:48.520 --> 10:54.580]  And that made me laugh for like fucking 90 seconds.
[10:54.700 --> 10:55.600]  I shit you not.
[10:56.280 --> 11:00.500]  I was so tickled and also so mad for not thinking of it.
[11:00.540 --> 11:02.400]  Cause we could have put it in the video to advertise it.
[11:02.640 --> 11:03.860]  Get ready for the throat down.
[11:03.940 --> 11:06.920]  Whoever you were is, that's the funniest thing I read in the month of November.
[11:07.060 --> 11:07.580]  Thank you.
[11:08.320 --> 11:10.240]  Get ready for the throat down.
[11:11.100 --> 11:11.840]  It's the throat off.
[11:14.540 --> 11:17.620]  I'm not surprised that I came in last in that thing.
[11:18.140 --> 11:22.340]  It's funny seeing people submit their own and how they measure up.
[11:22.400 --> 11:22.980]  It's been fun.
[11:23.320 --> 11:25.060]  There's some big ass mouths out there.
[11:25.440 --> 11:25.700]  Yeah.
[11:26.080 --> 11:26.920]  Did anyone get to the E?
[11:27.240 --> 11:29.080]  I don't think I've seen any E's.
[11:29.280 --> 11:32.140]  No, but there's been some like mid G's, mid U's even.
[11:32.340 --> 11:34.360]  There's like some pretty insane.
[11:35.100 --> 11:36.820]  Wait, how'd they get to a G?
[11:37.200 --> 11:38.200]  R, no, sorry.
[11:38.580 --> 11:40.340]  I'm looking, I'm thinking about it upside down.
[11:42.260 --> 11:43.420]  What do you mean?
[11:43.600 --> 11:44.800]  What do you mean upside down?
[11:44.920 --> 11:45.680]  Other way around.
[11:45.860 --> 11:46.740]  R, I was thinking R.
[11:46.740 --> 11:47.820]  R, okay.
[11:47.980 --> 11:49.360]  Hey, Jeff, just want to check on you.
[11:49.420 --> 11:50.360]  Make sure you're okay.
[11:50.580 --> 11:51.480]  Are you okay?
[11:52.880 --> 11:53.640]  I'm okay.
[11:57.080 --> 11:59.100]  I had a freak injury.
[11:59.600 --> 12:00.400]  I had a new injury.
[12:00.560 --> 12:00.680]  Oh no.
[12:01.220 --> 12:01.860]  Is it chair based?
[12:02.360 --> 12:04.020]  It is chair based, yeah.
[12:05.060 --> 12:08.080]  I want to talk to you guys about it as a side.
[12:08.200 --> 12:10.560]  It's sort of a, it was not fun.
[12:11.660 --> 12:16.260]  I spilled, I had a thing of toothpicks on my desk and I spilled them.
[12:16.740 --> 12:19.500]  I picked them up and I thought I got them all, but I didn't.
[12:20.260 --> 12:25.500]  One of them got wedged in the little gap between the wheel of my chair
[12:25.500 --> 12:27.880]  and like the plastic on the outside of it.
[12:28.220 --> 12:29.360]  And I didn't notice it.
[12:29.920 --> 12:33.820]  And so I went to sit down and it was one of those things where as this does,
[12:33.960 --> 12:36.180]  wasn't thinking, sat down, move my foot across.
[12:36.520 --> 12:39.520]  And then I just felt something enter my toe instantly.
[12:40.420 --> 12:42.060]  And there wasn't pain to it.
[12:42.080 --> 12:43.940]  It's just like that, that's not great.
[12:44.480 --> 12:47.480]  Uh, the way the toothpick was lodged in the wheel,
[12:47.540 --> 12:51.640]  it was pointing out like a sharp edge and it went right into one of my toes.
[12:52.680 --> 12:55.500]  To the point where like, I couldn't just pull it out.
[12:55.500 --> 12:58.220]  I had to have somebody help remove it.
[12:58.860 --> 13:00.520]  And it wasn't painful.
[13:00.720 --> 13:04.280]  Like it was relatively, like it was not a bad injury,
[13:04.840 --> 13:06.960]  but it made it annoying to walk the next day.
[13:07.640 --> 13:12.020]  And I thought about like all the times in my life I've fallen off of hills
[13:12.020 --> 13:14.840]  or I've like taken blows, been in car accidents
[13:14.840 --> 13:17.680]  and have been relatively unaffected.
[13:17.840 --> 13:23.040]  But how annoying it was having this toothpick injury on my toe for like two days.
[13:23.500 --> 13:26.540]  What is like the least cool injury you guys have had?
[13:26.600 --> 13:27.800]  Like that was impactful.
[13:28.620 --> 13:29.720]  Is there ever something where it was like,
[13:29.840 --> 13:32.160]  I don't know, you threw your back out trying to grab something
[13:32.160 --> 13:34.180]  and it just fucked you up as opposed to
[13:34.180 --> 13:37.340]  what on paper you would think would have done way more damage?
[13:38.040 --> 13:41.260]  Emily threw a dog toy at me when we were playing one night
[13:41.260 --> 13:44.220]  and I flinched in such a way that my shoulder locked up
[13:44.220 --> 13:46.940]  and I had to go to physical fucking therapy for six months.
[13:50.220 --> 13:51.060]  That's mine.
[13:51.920 --> 13:52.900]  That's so good.
[13:53.140 --> 13:54.300]  When did this happen?
[13:54.620 --> 13:55.560]  During Fuck Face.
[13:55.640 --> 13:57.340]  It was in the middle of our fucking podcast.
[13:57.440 --> 13:58.440]  We probably talked about it.
[13:58.480 --> 14:00.020]  I probably told the story on air.
[14:01.200 --> 14:03.140]  I feel like I would have remembered that.
[14:03.160 --> 14:06.780]  I still have to do stretches every morning in the shower
[14:06.780 --> 14:09.060]  with my left fucking arm and shoulder.
[14:09.780 --> 14:13.080]  Did that put a cap on your 80 mile per hour pitch?
[14:13.300 --> 14:13.980]  Is that why?
[14:14.600 --> 14:18.880]  It was in the... that was in the era where all the injuries started.
[14:19.800 --> 14:22.060]  You fucking pinpointed when it happened.
[14:22.320 --> 14:25.240]  It happened right around there when I couldn't get fucking healthy
[14:25.240 --> 14:26.420]  long enough to throw a pitch.
[14:26.560 --> 14:30.240]  I couldn't fucking lift my arm above my nipple for about,
[14:30.400 --> 14:32.240]  I don't know, a month there after that.
[14:32.480 --> 14:33.300]  It was... ugh.
[14:34.120 --> 14:34.780]  I'm still not right.
[14:35.160 --> 14:36.100]  Was it immediate when you flinched?
[14:36.100 --> 14:37.460]  It was immediate.
[14:37.760 --> 14:38.680]  It like locked up.
[14:39.060 --> 14:41.240]  And I like fell over and I went, oh no.
[14:41.400 --> 14:43.900]  And Emily was laughing at me because I'm fucking 100 years old.
[14:44.040 --> 14:46.140]  And then it was a trip to the physical therapist.
[14:46.300 --> 14:49.680]  And then it was a trip to the physical therapist every week for six months, I think.
[14:53.520 --> 14:54.480]  How about you?
[14:54.880 --> 14:57.020]  I'd love to see a photo of the dog toy.
[14:57.320 --> 14:58.200]  Just at some point.
[14:58.500 --> 15:01.560]  I think it was... I think it was Puss Puss or Owl Owl.
[15:01.680 --> 15:02.440]  It was one of those two.
[15:02.480 --> 15:03.200]  That's perfect.
[15:03.340 --> 15:04.120]  Oh wow.
[15:05.360 --> 15:07.060]  Yeah, it was one of them for sure.
[15:07.560 --> 15:08.540]  It's tough to beat.
[15:08.720 --> 15:09.680]  Gavin, do you have one of those?
[15:10.260 --> 15:15.380]  I had a Nerf Maverick when I was 15 or something.
[15:16.140 --> 15:19.640]  A little revolver Nerf gun that shoots a little suction dart.
[15:20.260 --> 15:22.200]  And I fired it and the thing come out.
[15:22.320 --> 15:22.920]  I was like, huh.
[15:23.460 --> 15:30.480]  So I just looked directly down the barrel and pulled the trigger and it suctioned to my eye.
[15:33.380 --> 15:35.160]  It was stuck on the front of my eye.
[15:36.740 --> 15:38.000]  What did you do?
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.100]  Did you pull it off on me or did you freak out?
[15:40.360 --> 15:40.980]  I freaked out.
[15:41.180 --> 15:42.640]  I freaked the goddamn out.
[15:42.780 --> 15:44.600]  And I was like trying to close my eye to knock it off.
[15:44.720 --> 15:45.800]  And it came off pretty quickly.
[15:45.960 --> 15:49.480]  It was maybe it was stuck there for like two seconds, but it hurt so much.
[15:49.560 --> 15:50.920]  Like it came with such force.
[15:51.220 --> 15:54.080]  I just didn't understand what I was seeing.
[15:54.520 --> 15:56.760]  Okay, well, there was no information, but I was just like...
[15:59.680 --> 16:00.680]  How old were you?
[16:01.720 --> 16:03.980]  I was probably like 16, 15 maybe.
[16:04.980 --> 16:06.820]  So much older than I thought you were going to say.
[16:06.840 --> 16:07.140]  Yeah.
[16:09.220 --> 16:11.300]  Dude, that reminds me of...
[16:11.300 --> 16:15.340]  Bernie and Gus and I had a paintball phase for a little bit there for about...
[16:15.340 --> 16:15.700]  I don't know.
[16:15.780 --> 16:17.180]  I had a paintball phase for about four months.
[16:17.240 --> 16:18.320]  I think there's less than about six.
[16:18.820 --> 16:20.360]  I fell out before they did.
[16:20.720 --> 16:24.120]  But we would go and play in the woods behind the call center where we used to work, right?
[16:24.600 --> 16:29.220]  And one day I put on my army boots, my steel toed army boots.
[16:29.520 --> 16:32.860]  And while I was in the woods, like waiting for Bernie or Gus or whatever,
[16:32.940 --> 16:34.540]  I just had my paintball gun in my hand.
[16:34.540 --> 16:36.120]  And I thought, huh.
[16:36.360 --> 16:42.420]  And I just pointed it at my foot, like, I don't know, six inches above my fucking toe,
[16:42.540 --> 16:47.200]  my big toe, and just shot it and found out that I did not have steel toe boots.
[16:48.700 --> 16:51.720]  I just had regular boots and they were like cardboard.
[16:52.300 --> 16:56.540]  And that was one of the most blindingly painful moments of my life, I think.
[16:56.680 --> 16:59.080]  I'm so glad you reminded me of all this embarrassment.
[16:59.420 --> 17:01.460]  It's so annoying when you just do it to yourself.
[17:01.460 --> 17:02.620]  No one to blame.
[17:03.040 --> 17:04.980]  Nothing really surprising happened.
[17:05.180 --> 17:06.040]  It's just all your fault.
[17:06.760 --> 17:07.160]  Yeah.
[17:07.360 --> 17:11.600]  You have to sit there for a second and think like, how did I do that?
[17:11.780 --> 17:13.940]  And you have to like, why did my brain...
[17:14.840 --> 17:16.060]  What was I thinking?
[17:16.400 --> 17:20.100]  You just try to understand your own stupidity and there's just nothing there.
[17:20.280 --> 17:25.080]  And you realize, I'm just operating on instinct half the time.
[17:25.200 --> 17:27.880]  I'm just a dumb animal.
[17:29.560 --> 17:33.740]  I don't think I've ever felt like more of an oaf than whenever I would play paintball.
[17:34.200 --> 17:36.900]  And the handful of times I did it, just terrible.
[17:37.220 --> 17:38.300]  Just in all forms.
[17:38.920 --> 17:40.920]  Masks steaming up, can't see.
[17:41.360 --> 17:46.180]  Every single time I'd play, I would fuck up the ammo at some point and just spill it everywhere.
[17:46.460 --> 17:49.040]  Like, I just said completely incompetent.
[17:49.120 --> 17:52.820]  It's so funny when people are like, checking their hopper,
[17:52.900 --> 17:56.980]  see if they got any paintballs left and they get shot in the gun and they all just go flying.
[17:57.540 --> 18:00.140]  There's lots of like, really funny shit that could happen in paintball.
[18:00.660 --> 18:01.220]  So much.
[18:02.680 --> 18:05.480]  And it's one of those sports where like, the better you are, the labor it looks.
[18:05.960 --> 18:06.280]  Oh yeah.
[18:06.700 --> 18:06.880]  Yeah.
[18:07.840 --> 18:09.180]  There's no way to look cool in paintball.
[18:09.620 --> 18:09.840]  Yeah.
[18:10.240 --> 18:11.300]  You play much paintball, Gavin?
[18:11.700 --> 18:14.600]  I played probably, I don't know, 10 times.
[18:15.280 --> 18:15.720]  Oh wow.
[18:16.200 --> 18:17.240]  That's more than I would have guessed.
[18:18.080 --> 18:18.600]  Yeah, it's fun.
[18:19.160 --> 18:20.580]  Like a semi-pro over there.
[18:21.060 --> 18:21.320]  Yeah.
[18:22.440 --> 18:26.320]  I mean, he's not shooting himself in the foot with the backwoods, but...
[18:26.980 --> 18:27.780]  It's not his way.
[18:30.580 --> 18:36.640]  Hey, I had an idea I wanted to pitch you guys for about a month now.
[18:36.860 --> 18:39.120]  I mentioned it to Andrew the other day and he seemed to like it.
[18:39.260 --> 18:41.080]  I keep missing it.
[18:41.160 --> 18:43.760]  I think this is the fifth podcast I've tried to bring it up.
[18:44.580 --> 18:47.940]  And I'm just going to shoehorn it in because I really want to try it.
[18:48.140 --> 18:50.960]  And I keep forgetting to talk about it.
[18:51.440 --> 18:53.520]  A while back, I started watching this TikTok channel.
[18:54.040 --> 18:55.680]  I'll send it to you guys if you're not familiar with it.
[18:55.920 --> 18:56.500]  This is on YouTube.
[18:56.500 --> 18:57.800]  It's called Shitty Places.
[18:58.120 --> 19:02.420]  And it's just this fucking dude from Texas who wears like a backwards Hurley hat.
[19:02.640 --> 19:06.100]  And he just has Google Maps open and he just does street view.
[19:06.240 --> 19:08.320]  And he goes like, today, we're going to look at Baltimore.
[19:08.960 --> 19:09.540]  Let's see.
[19:09.620 --> 19:12.180]  We're going to drop five pins and we're going to see, is it shitty?
[19:12.500 --> 19:14.540]  And he just drops in a pin and he does a 360 view.
[19:14.560 --> 19:15.680]  And he's like, not shitty.
[19:15.880 --> 19:19.980]  And then he goes to one and he's like, it's shitty.
[19:20.400 --> 19:22.060]  And it's just funny the way he says it's shitty.
[19:22.060 --> 19:27.380]  But there's something so soothing about watching him just drop into the world and spin around.
[19:27.500 --> 19:35.500]  And you know, I'm really into geolocators and stuff, but that's not content for us.
[19:36.300 --> 19:37.100]  Geolocation, I don't think.
[19:37.140 --> 19:39.080]  I think it's not the kind of thing we do.
[19:39.360 --> 19:40.760]  The thing we do is a little silly and irreverent.
[19:40.820 --> 19:44.460]  So I was trying to figure out, how do you essentially take the spirit of what they're
[19:44.460 --> 19:46.340]  doing and turn it into Sloppy Joe's bingo?
[19:46.340 --> 19:54.800]  And I had an idea for Geo Bingo, where we come up with a bunch of prompts, like a stop
[19:54.800 --> 20:02.180]  sign, somebody pushing a stroller, walking a dog, swimming pool, McDonald's, stop sign
[20:02.180 --> 20:04.000]  in a different language, whatever.
[20:04.540 --> 20:08.880]  And you fill out your bingo cards and then one person drives and just drops into the
[20:08.880 --> 20:10.700]  world and we do a 360 view.
[20:10.900 --> 20:14.360]  And then we just play bingo that way and see who can fill out a card first.
[20:15.180 --> 20:16.320]  I want to play.
[20:16.800 --> 20:17.660]  Yeah, I think it's a lot of fun.
[20:18.420 --> 20:22.280]  How often do you know they change the images for like a Street View thing?
[20:23.300 --> 20:24.600]  Is it frequent or is it rare?
[20:24.740 --> 20:28.180]  I think about once a year, maybe, depending on how busy your area is.
[20:28.920 --> 20:33.300]  Because I know I've gone, I've gone back through Google Street View and been able to
[20:33.300 --> 20:37.560]  go back like every year to see like houses in my old neighborhood change back to like
[20:37.560 --> 20:38.680]  2010, I think I could go.
[20:39.080 --> 20:45.860]  It could be a lot of fun to if one of us wanted to like block off, like, I don't know, a few
[20:45.860 --> 20:51.100]  blocks of a place and then do a scavenger hunt that, you know, like is findable type thing.
[20:51.380 --> 20:52.760]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[20:52.980 --> 20:54.960]  So you would like pre-scout to come up with the prompt?
[20:55.120 --> 20:58.540]  Yeah, you would get like you would pre-scout and you would tell everybody like, hey, it's
[20:58.540 --> 21:01.460]  a six block or whatever radius of this place.
[21:01.760 --> 21:06.620]  And so, you know, it's findable and it's just trying to figure out where and then doing
[21:06.620 --> 21:07.920]  like a race that way.
[21:08.680 --> 21:10.120]  Like a scavenger hunt type race.
[21:10.200 --> 21:10.880]  Yeah, all that stuff.
[21:11.020 --> 21:14.920]  I think that would be a lot of fun with Falcons because they would be able to play also.
[21:15.220 --> 21:19.060]  Yeah, we would be able to drop that for people and they can try to find it at the same time
[21:19.060 --> 21:19.420]  we do.
[21:19.580 --> 21:22.800]  I think a scavenger hunt of like a six block radius would be a lot of fun.
[21:23.120 --> 21:23.880]  That's a really cool idea.
[21:24.200 --> 21:24.300]  Yeah.
[21:25.220 --> 21:28.780]  Anyway, I think there's something here in all of this, but I'd love to try to get together
[21:28.780 --> 21:31.080]  and do a geo scavenger hunt or a geo bingo.
[21:31.780 --> 21:33.340]  You know, we could do it location specific.
[21:33.460 --> 21:37.740]  We could do it just in Austin or Nanaimo or we could do it in fucking Deputy, Indiana
[21:37.740 --> 21:43.500]  if we wanted to, you know, and so there could be themed episodes and I don't know,
[21:43.520 --> 21:47.560]  it might be something that if it's if it's fun, I don't think it's as fun as like a sloppy
[21:47.560 --> 21:49.100]  just bingo, but I think it's worth trying.
[21:49.420 --> 21:50.100]  Yeah, absolutely.
[21:50.760 --> 21:51.780]  I think it could be a lot of fun.
[21:52.580 --> 21:53.200]  It's a great idea.
[21:53.720 --> 21:54.300]  Thanks, man.
[21:54.980 --> 21:55.560]  I'll put it on the list.
[21:55.560 --> 21:56.160]  Definitely have to try it.
[21:58.120 --> 22:01.760]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[22:02.080 --> 22:06.800]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love now topped with a creamy layer of
[22:06.800 --> 22:10.580]  handcrafted brown sugar cold foam available for a limited time.
[22:10.800 --> 22:12.920]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[22:13.960 --> 22:16.560]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[22:17.020 --> 22:20.220]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[22:20.680 --> 22:22.460]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,
[22:22.680 --> 22:25.900]  a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.
[22:26.060 --> 22:30.340]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone or using the award-winning app,
[22:30.600 --> 22:34.080]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[22:34.500 --> 22:36.340]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[22:40.320 --> 22:42.980]  Uh, I have a... I have a really stupid problem.
[22:43.420 --> 22:43.760]  A dilemma.
[22:44.620 --> 22:45.320]  I need help.
[22:45.840 --> 22:46.360]  Okay.
[22:46.880 --> 22:48.120]  I don't know the answer to this.
[22:48.440 --> 22:49.100]  Well, I kind of do.
[22:50.100 --> 22:51.740]  Do people just eat cranberries?
[22:52.120 --> 22:53.500]  Like, normal cranberries?
[22:54.120 --> 22:55.920]  Not... like, obviously there's sauce.
[22:56.500 --> 22:57.840]  Do people just eat the berry?
[22:58.540 --> 23:00.260]  Uh, I don't think so, no.
[23:00.620 --> 23:00.940]  Not really.
[23:01.400 --> 23:03.480]  Cause I... so there's...
[23:04.380 --> 23:07.820]  I enjoy, uh, whenever, like, Star...
[23:07.820 --> 23:08.940]  I love a new lemonade.
[23:09.340 --> 23:12.340]  Starbucks has a new lemonade for the fall season.
[23:12.740 --> 23:13.660]  And I got it.
[23:14.120 --> 23:18.120]  I have a friend who we're talking about drinking, like, fruit-type drinks.
[23:18.300 --> 23:19.580]  And they never have the fruit.
[23:19.660 --> 23:21.040]  They never eat the fruit that's in it.
[23:21.100 --> 23:22.040]  And I thought that was weird.
[23:22.520 --> 23:23.460]  So you have to eat the fruit.
[23:24.260 --> 23:27.180]  But I've been ordering these and they have cranberry in them.
[23:27.460 --> 23:29.340]  And it's just a bunch of sliced cranberry.
[23:29.980 --> 23:32.200]  And I've been eating it because that's...
[23:32.200 --> 23:33.760]  Do you eat the fruit when you're not the drink?
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.060]  But it is a really unpleasant experience to the point where I just...
[23:37.540 --> 23:38.260]  I don't know.
[23:38.340 --> 23:39.380]  Do people eat these?
[23:39.520 --> 23:41.960]  Made me realize I've never seen anyone just eat cranberry.
[23:42.440 --> 23:44.400]  Cranberries are pretty... pretty tart fruit.
[23:44.720 --> 23:45.340]  Yeah, they're hot on them.
[23:45.580 --> 23:46.160]  Super tart.
[23:46.240 --> 23:49.160]  Yeah, I think they're, like, they're, like, really, like, like, astringent.
[23:49.460 --> 23:51.440]  Really, like, they make you go...
[23:52.020 --> 23:52.460]  Like that.
[23:52.520 --> 23:53.480]  They do, yes.
[23:53.980 --> 23:54.900]  That's why you cut...
[23:54.900 --> 23:59.280]  Everything that's got cranberry in it is, like, fucking heavily doused in sugar.
[23:59.840 --> 24:00.500]  Well, when you've...
[24:01.260 --> 24:04.220]  When you have a, like, a water with lemon, do you eat the lemon?
[24:04.800 --> 24:05.380]  I do sometimes.
[24:06.180 --> 24:08.420]  Yeah, no, typically not. That's a good point.
[24:09.020 --> 24:10.660]  I'll squeeze it into the drink.
[24:10.940 --> 24:14.740]  But you never, like, fish the lime out of a Corona and tuck in?
[24:15.540 --> 24:19.320]  No, I guess in my mind, though, because I'm squeezing it, like, I'm already...
[24:19.320 --> 24:21.340]  I'm, like, eating it with my hands.
[24:21.840 --> 24:22.120]  Yeah.
[24:23.080 --> 24:26.660]  Like, it wouldn't even cross my mind to try to eat a squeezed lemon
[24:26.660 --> 24:28.920]  because I've already... I've gotten all the juice out.
[24:30.160 --> 24:33.740]  I just was curious if I've been eating this drink wrong, I guess.
[24:34.320 --> 24:38.360]  Because, like, typically it'll be strawberries or dragon fruit or pineapple,
[24:38.840 --> 24:41.380]  all very edible fruits that I enjoy eating.
[24:41.960 --> 24:46.340]  But I've been having these cranberry drinks and there'll be a giant thing of cranberries
[24:46.340 --> 24:49.960]  at the bottom that I've been eating and going, this is really unpleasant.
[24:50.500 --> 24:53.000]  Do I just not like cranberries or are these not for me?
[24:53.440 --> 24:56.280]  Why don't you just eat one and then be like, I don't like cranberries?
[24:56.600 --> 24:59.640]  Eating this drink wrong and you keep going back to it, going,
[24:59.900 --> 25:01.900]  guys, I gotta be fucking this up.
[25:02.000 --> 25:03.180]  This has to be on me.
[25:03.180 --> 25:05.640]  Well, it's like a thing where I don't know.
[25:06.240 --> 25:07.740]  It's not like I can eat it.
[25:07.800 --> 25:09.640]  And I don't. It's not the worst.
[25:10.140 --> 25:11.920]  I enjoy, I guess, having fruit.
[25:11.960 --> 25:14.280]  It can be refreshing, but...
[25:14.280 --> 25:15.160]  But you don't enjoy it.
[25:16.020 --> 25:17.460]  Yeah, I don't really, I guess.
[25:17.880 --> 25:19.220]  Andrew, yeah, I know.
[25:20.020 --> 25:24.880]  Andrew, it's a cranberry orange refresher, right?
[25:25.380 --> 25:25.620]  Yeah.
[25:25.780 --> 25:27.620]  So are there oranges in it as well?
[25:28.060 --> 25:28.900]  I don't think so.
[25:28.980 --> 25:33.160]  I think Starbucks just lies about whatever the second thing is and they got in trouble.
[25:33.160 --> 25:38.840]  Like, I think they did like a dragon fruit something.
[25:39.660 --> 25:40.840]  Mango dragon fruit.
[25:40.960 --> 25:42.040]  There was no mango in it.
[25:42.180 --> 25:46.160]  Like, I just I think they just lie about what the second thing is.
[25:46.360 --> 25:48.240]  I don't think anybody eats raw cranberries.
[25:49.200 --> 25:53.180]  So I should stop eating the cranberries in the cranberry orange refresher.
[25:53.180 --> 25:55.440]  If you don't like them, then yes.
[25:56.220 --> 25:56.940]  It's not.
[25:57.060 --> 25:59.320]  It's just it was like, do people do this?
[25:59.320 --> 26:02.780]  I guess, you know, honestly, Andrew, I think you got to try it.
[26:02.780 --> 26:05.280]  One more time.
[26:05.740 --> 26:08.620]  Dude, the next cranberries might be really good cranberries.
[26:08.860 --> 26:12.500]  The problem was the first time I ordered it, I ordered extra cranberries.
[26:12.660 --> 26:16.040]  I doubled the cranberry amount because I was like, let's get some real flavor in this.
[26:16.540 --> 26:16.840]  Wait, you...
[26:20.780 --> 26:21.740]  Do you...
[26:21.740 --> 26:23.020]  What the fuck?
[26:23.340 --> 26:24.840]  What the fuck?
[26:25.120 --> 26:26.160]  I'm surprised that was an option.
[26:26.240 --> 26:27.000]  What are you talking about?
[26:27.260 --> 26:30.260]  I doubled it and I was like, that was way too many cranberries.
[26:30.260 --> 26:33.820]  And then I ordered it again with just the base amount.
[26:33.960 --> 26:37.240]  And it was still a lot of cranberries that I end up with at the bottom.
[26:37.540 --> 26:42.100]  And I just eat and it just never occurred to me.
[26:42.300 --> 26:43.920]  I was just curious, do people eat these?
[26:44.420 --> 26:47.520]  But based on what you say, you didn't particularly enjoy the normal amount.
[26:47.680 --> 26:49.580]  So why would you double them?
[26:49.860 --> 26:51.820]  Well, sometimes you can have too much of a thing.
[26:53.040 --> 26:56.120]  So the first time I ordered it, it was two extra.
[26:57.660 --> 27:00.060]  So you decided to back off on it a little bit.
[27:00.060 --> 27:03.600]  And then I had the 1x and it was still a lot of cranberries.
[27:04.240 --> 27:07.180]  And then it just made me rethink, like, am I not...
[27:07.180 --> 27:09.820]  Is this the only one you're not supposed to eat the fruit?
[27:09.940 --> 27:11.760]  Were you not supposed to eat the fruit on the other ones?
[27:11.760 --> 27:13.000]  And I've been doing it anyway.
[27:13.880 --> 27:15.480]  What are the protocols to this?
[27:16.420 --> 27:17.960]  I think if it's in there, it's edible.
[27:18.780 --> 27:19.100]  Yeah.
[27:19.560 --> 27:19.880]  Technically.
[27:20.360 --> 27:20.960]  That's true.
[27:21.340 --> 27:24.000]  They couldn't really put, like, non-food in it.
[27:24.420 --> 27:25.160]  That's very true.
[27:25.280 --> 27:26.080]  I just am more of...
[27:26.080 --> 27:29.280]  I'm somebody who, across the making of the show,
[27:29.360 --> 27:32.500]  have realized that my instincts for these things are not necessarily
[27:33.240 --> 27:35.280]  the same as other people's.
[27:35.900 --> 27:37.300]  Have you had...
[27:37.300 --> 27:41.520]  So when you ordered twice as many cranberries, have you had that drink before?
[27:42.120 --> 27:42.400]  No.
[27:43.080 --> 27:44.700]  Okay, so you're insane.
[27:45.100 --> 27:47.620]  I just really wanted a lot of cranberry in it.
[27:47.740 --> 27:48.200]  I was like...
[27:48.200 --> 27:48.240]  Why?
[27:49.340 --> 27:51.500]  Because I like cranberry mixes.
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.080]  And so I thought extra flavor, I guess.
[27:54.240 --> 27:54.680]  I don't know.
[27:54.680 --> 27:56.200]  Jeff, do something.
[27:56.720 --> 27:59.280]  I also don't know if they're roasted or not.
[27:59.860 --> 28:00.840]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[28:01.460 --> 28:02.260]  Here's what I'm gonna do, Andrew.
[28:02.560 --> 28:02.880]  Roasted?
[28:03.500 --> 28:08.220]  How do you cook a cranberry and not melt it into cranberry sauce?
[28:08.280 --> 28:09.660]  Because I make cranberry sauce.
[28:09.740 --> 28:10.440]  I know how that works.
[28:10.680 --> 28:11.520]  Like a boiled one?
[28:12.020 --> 28:12.320]  Yeah.
[28:12.620 --> 28:13.340]  Like, is it...
[28:13.340 --> 28:17.780]  I don't know if they've done something to the cranberry or if it's just a raw cranberry.
[28:18.060 --> 28:19.460]  This is my favorite.
[28:19.980 --> 28:21.620]  This is so crazy.
[28:22.220 --> 28:24.100]  Twice as many cranberries, please.
[28:24.680 --> 28:29.200]  Do you think they do something to the blueberry or the strawberry before they throw it in a drink?
[28:30.800 --> 28:32.900]  They are, I think, frozen.
[28:33.380 --> 28:34.620]  Yeah, they give a quick roast.
[28:36.100 --> 28:38.240]  Put them on the old barbecue.
[28:39.780 --> 28:42.060]  Cranberries roasting on an open grill.
[28:42.320 --> 28:43.480]  Here's what I'm gonna do, Andrew.
[28:43.860 --> 28:44.760]  Here's what I'm gonna do, Eric.
[28:45.600 --> 28:48.900]  I'm gonna go to Starbucks and I'm gonna get one of these fucking things because it looks delicious.
[28:49.240 --> 28:50.040]  It's so good.
[28:50.200 --> 28:53.620]  Then I'm gonna eat the cranberry and I'll determine if you're supposed to eat it or not.
[28:53.620 --> 28:54.560]  Thank you.
[28:54.860 --> 28:59.360]  As a fruit fan, I'll be able to make a professional determination one way or the other.
[29:00.340 --> 29:01.720]  You should order one now for delivery.
[29:02.300 --> 29:03.140]  Oh, let me see if I can do that.
[29:04.320 --> 29:06.500]  It won't get here before the podcast is over, but let me see.
[29:08.400 --> 29:08.800]  Uber.
[29:10.380 --> 29:11.520]  On a triple cranberry.
[29:12.420 --> 29:12.820]  Eats.
[29:13.600 --> 29:15.000]  I've never had it before.
[29:15.180 --> 29:16.160]  Double the cranberries.
[29:16.500 --> 29:16.860]  Now.
[29:16.880 --> 29:18.360]  Yeah, that's why I'm going double for the...
[29:19.480 --> 29:20.260]  Off the bat.
[29:21.100 --> 29:21.500]  Starbucks?
[29:21.500 --> 29:22.700]  That is...
[29:22.700 --> 29:24.540]  That is the craziest, Andrew.
[29:24.680 --> 29:25.620]  That is the craziest.
[29:25.620 --> 29:27.360]  Am I trying something?
[29:27.560 --> 29:28.900]  I wouldn't modify it yet.
[29:28.980 --> 29:30.920]  No, you have to try the base.
[29:31.220 --> 29:32.420]  Like double the...
[29:32.420 --> 29:33.940]  Also, they're cranberries.
[29:34.040 --> 29:35.320]  The thing that I...
[29:35.320 --> 29:36.120]  You can't eat.
[29:36.280 --> 29:37.280]  I don't know, man.
[29:37.460 --> 29:37.920]  I don't know.
[29:38.100 --> 29:38.940]  Well, that's the thing.
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.240]  I've never had a cranberry outside of the sauce.
[29:41.320 --> 29:46.980]  So I thought if it's in the drink, then it must be eatable the same way that I'd never had a dragon
[29:46.980 --> 29:49.340]  fruit before getting their drink.
[29:49.340 --> 29:53.500]  Now, this is the cranberry orange refresher.
[29:53.760 --> 29:55.040]  Yeah, the lemonade refresher.
[29:55.320 --> 29:55.760]  A different one.
[29:55.840 --> 29:57.520]  No, lemonade refresher, because there's...
[29:58.100 --> 30:01.960]  There's cranberry orange refresher or cranberry orange lemonade.
[30:02.300 --> 30:03.440]  Do you want cranberry orange lemonade?
[30:03.560 --> 30:04.680]  I do the lemonade.
[30:04.840 --> 30:05.120]  Yeah.
[30:05.240 --> 30:06.020]  Refresher, personally.
[30:06.040 --> 30:07.460]  OK, cranberry orange lemonade refresher.
[30:07.480 --> 30:08.300]  In my defense.
[30:09.260 --> 30:10.240]  Oh, it looks like...
[30:10.240 --> 30:10.440]  OK.
[30:11.180 --> 30:13.980]  Oh, I paid 95 cents for additional cranberry fruit.
[30:14.080 --> 30:15.060]  That is a wild move.
[30:15.160 --> 30:16.180]  You're crazy.
[30:16.600 --> 30:17.000]  Wow.
[30:18.000 --> 30:18.780]  That was a bad decision.
[30:18.780 --> 30:20.920]  I'm going to up the cranberry fruit.
[30:21.120 --> 30:21.460]  OK.
[30:22.840 --> 30:23.640]  Wait, Jeff?
[30:23.760 --> 30:24.720]  It's an extra dollar.
[30:25.020 --> 30:25.500]  All right.
[30:26.460 --> 30:30.940]  Do you think anyone anywhere has ever had just cheese pizza their whole life and then thought,
[30:31.020 --> 30:32.400]  I'm going to try pepperoni.
[30:32.780 --> 30:34.780]  I'm going to ask for double pepperoni.
[30:34.780 --> 30:35.820]  Double the pepperoni.
[30:36.940 --> 30:37.600]  Check out.
[30:39.600 --> 30:41.080]  Priority to getting it right now.
[30:41.200 --> 30:43.800]  Dude, you should get the salted caramel cold brew, too.
[30:43.840 --> 30:44.340]  But that's just...
[30:44.340 --> 30:45.740]  Oh, I already ordered.
[30:45.920 --> 30:48.380]  I already had two coffees today.
[30:48.380 --> 30:49.260]  I can't be having the third.
[30:49.380 --> 30:50.900]  I had two coffees.
[30:50.900 --> 30:52.880]  Dude, I had two coffees off the rip today.
[30:53.020 --> 30:53.940]  I woke up so early.
[30:54.220 --> 30:55.220]  I needed it.
[30:55.340 --> 30:55.780]  It was rough.
[30:56.460 --> 30:58.440]  I had a nice little hot coffee in the morning.
[30:58.520 --> 31:01.460]  Then I walked to the coffee shop today and had a nice iced coffee.
[31:01.820 --> 31:02.940]  And I texted Gavin and I was like...
[31:05.820 --> 31:08.860]  I was texting Gavin and I was trying to give us in that we need to live in the same neighborhood
[31:08.860 --> 31:13.380]  because we could have so much fun doing activities and getting up to shenanigans in the daytime.
[31:14.500 --> 31:15.540]  I was trying to explain to him.
[31:15.540 --> 31:18.280]  I feel like a kid who...
[31:18.280 --> 31:19.980]  Because, you know, I just moved not too long ago.
[31:20.800 --> 31:24.520]  I feel like a kid who is on summer break and just moved to a new neighborhood,
[31:24.540 --> 31:26.260]  but he doesn't know anybody in the neighborhood yet.
[31:26.300 --> 31:28.760]  But he wants to go out and walk around and do stuff and ride bikes.
[31:28.780 --> 31:30.920]  But he just doesn't have any friends in the neighborhood yet, you know?
[31:31.180 --> 31:32.060]  He hasn't met anybody.
[31:32.460 --> 31:33.120]  Kind of frustrating.
[31:34.100 --> 31:35.600]  When you first described it,
[31:35.780 --> 31:38.240]  you said it like you're part of the fucking little rascals.
[31:38.580 --> 31:40.600]  And then everything that furthered it.
[31:40.980 --> 31:42.720]  He's running around sticking bananas in tailpipes.
[31:42.880 --> 31:43.660]  He's doing whatever, man.
[31:43.720 --> 31:44.540]  That's what I want to do.
[31:44.540 --> 31:46.280]  I want to hang out, ride bikes and be a kid.
[31:46.380 --> 31:48.720]  I feel fucking 14 years old all the time.
[31:49.160 --> 31:50.480]  And all I was doing was walking around.
[31:50.560 --> 31:53.380]  I was just seeing shenanigans and fun to get up to.
[31:54.020 --> 31:56.840]  One day we should try and retrace the path we took
[31:57.580 --> 31:59.920]  when we were looking for that thing that one time.
[32:01.740 --> 32:02.140]  Oh!
[32:03.520 --> 32:03.740]  What?
[32:04.960 --> 32:05.880]  Yeah, you got that, man?
[32:06.640 --> 32:09.320]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[32:09.820 --> 32:13.180]  Gavin's talking about this time at Rooster Teeth a million years ago.
[32:13.180 --> 32:16.160]  I think we've talked about it on camera at a bunch at this point
[32:16.160 --> 32:19.600]  where Jack got a thing stolen
[32:19.600 --> 32:22.360]  and we had to try to track it down and find it.
[32:22.520 --> 32:25.340]  And we, I don't...
[32:26.220 --> 32:27.780]  See, the problem with that was there were...
[32:27.780 --> 32:31.740]  That was a drug dens and crack houses and some real sketch.
[32:33.060 --> 32:35.220]  That wasn't my idea of shenanigans.
[32:35.380 --> 32:37.160]  I was going a little lighter with it, but yeah.
[32:37.360 --> 32:40.880]  I think at one point we'd climbed like over a dried up river
[32:40.880 --> 32:42.620]  past some tents and we got kolaches.
[32:43.880 --> 32:46.880]  Some guy took them bad for us and he gave us free kolaches.
[32:47.200 --> 32:49.520]  I mean, at this point, all those places that you went to
[32:49.520 --> 32:52.240]  are probably coffee shops and apartments, so...
[32:52.240 --> 32:53.280]  They're all condos, yeah.
[32:53.340 --> 32:55.060]  Yeah, exactly. So yeah, that's fun.
[32:55.600 --> 32:57.040]  Yeah, I guess it was 15 years ago.
[32:57.100 --> 32:58.280]  It's going to be a different path, I think.
[32:58.820 --> 33:00.620]  Jesus Christ, I bet we could find that dumpster still.
[33:03.910 --> 33:07.270]  It's funny that I've been in more dumpsters than most people in Austin.
[33:12.070 --> 33:14.870]  Yeah, we had to check the dumpsters in case they stashed it
[33:14.870 --> 33:17.350]  in a dumpster when they realized they couldn't figure out how to make it work.
[33:17.410 --> 33:18.250]  Because it was a dev kit.
[33:20.370 --> 33:24.570]  I have a topic on my list of notes that is actually your topic, Jeff.
[33:24.730 --> 33:26.170]  I don't know if you want to talk about it.
[33:26.310 --> 33:29.830]  You mentioned wanting to bring it up recently outside of the show.
[33:30.470 --> 33:31.350]  Well, I don't know.
[33:31.630 --> 33:35.270]  You've been having coffee shop villainous recently.
[33:41.880 --> 33:44.160]  I didn't think you were going to talk about that on the podcast.
[33:44.160 --> 33:47.020]  No, but he brought it up later that he wanted to talk about it.
[33:47.080 --> 33:48.620]  We have not talked about it in content.
[33:48.860 --> 33:51.360]  I don't remember bringing it up saying I want to talk about it, but we can.
[33:52.360 --> 33:55.140]  I'll speak about it in generic terms.
[33:55.520 --> 33:59.100]  I have moved to a different part of town.
[33:59.460 --> 34:01.800]  And with that comes changing your habits, right?
[34:01.840 --> 34:04.500]  So I go to three different coffee shops.
[34:04.580 --> 34:07.040]  Now I have a cycle that I go through because I don't want to be
[34:07.520 --> 34:09.540]  too much of a local in any one place.
[34:09.540 --> 34:12.040]  And I don't want to burn out on a place too quickly.
[34:12.200 --> 34:13.020]  You know, that can happen.
[34:13.580 --> 34:16.240]  And I also want to explore different parts of town, you know.
[34:16.660 --> 34:19.940]  And so I have like three coffee shops, actually four now,
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.940]  I just started going to a different one that I kind of cycle through.
[34:23.080 --> 34:27.620]  But the one that I go through the most often, I was in line one day
[34:27.620 --> 34:30.820]  and a couple of people in front of me was somebody that I recognized
[34:30.820 --> 34:37.500]  that I used to know in Austin a very, very, very long time ago.
[34:38.100 --> 34:40.740]  And it was somebody that was a friend of a friend.
[34:40.960 --> 34:42.940]  This is pre-Rooster Teeth, right?
[34:42.940 --> 34:44.560]  This is back when I worked at the tech support center.
[34:45.040 --> 34:46.580]  We were into the same kind of music.
[34:46.780 --> 34:49.620]  I would run into him at punk shows a lot, that kind of thing.
[34:49.820 --> 34:53.400]  I never knew him very well, and I never got the impression he liked me.
[34:54.280 --> 34:56.180]  And he was always kind of cold to me.
[34:56.520 --> 35:00.660]  And I always kind of felt just like, like the dude didn't dig me,
[35:00.840 --> 35:05.160]  which I'll be honest, I get like, I'm not everybody's cup of tea.
[35:05.420 --> 35:10.600]  I have had 49 years of a learning to understand that,
[35:10.600 --> 35:14.120]  but also understand myself and recognize that, yeah, like I get it, you know?
[35:14.480 --> 35:15.880]  And so I never took it personally.
[35:16.100 --> 35:18.660]  I always thought he was a little cooler than me, you know?
[35:18.740 --> 35:21.220]  And like, especially when you're younger and you're in like the punk scene and stuff,
[35:21.240 --> 35:22.040]  it's like, there's a whole thing.
[35:22.440 --> 35:25.980]  And so I always just kind of felt like bad about myself around him.
[35:26.040 --> 35:27.540]  So I just, I don't know.
[35:28.560 --> 35:30.380]  He was never mean to me or anything like that.
[35:30.560 --> 35:33.360]  He was never anything other than polite, I would say.
[35:34.040 --> 35:35.880]  You just like some people you just don't connect with
[35:35.880 --> 35:37.280]  or you just don't, you feel awkward around, right?
[35:37.280 --> 35:38.140]  It was one of those situations.
[35:38.160 --> 35:39.140]  And he was a friend of a friend.
[35:39.650 --> 35:42.120]  And I saw the dude in front of me and I thought,
[35:42.360 --> 35:46.100]  oh, fuck, I don't want to have to talk to him.
[35:46.420 --> 35:52.540]  Because it's been 16 years, maybe, since I've seen him.
[35:53.280 --> 35:56.300]  And I remember his name and that's about it.
[35:56.400 --> 35:58.300]  And I'm sure he remembers me in the same way.
[35:58.560 --> 36:03.080]  And I just hate awkward conversations with people that you used to know, you know?
[36:03.160 --> 36:05.380]  Like it's like, it's just the fucking worst.
[36:06.380 --> 36:08.560]  And I'm so awkward already.
[36:08.560 --> 36:12.160]  And the older I get, the more awkward I become.
[36:12.340 --> 36:14.120]  And the less I want to talk to people in general,
[36:14.440 --> 36:18.240]  let alone people that I thought didn't like me a decade and a half ago.
[36:18.740 --> 36:21.340]  And so I was like, uh, what do I do?
[36:21.440 --> 36:23.700]  And so I just kind of tried to stay behind him.
[36:23.720 --> 36:25.580]  And then he went and sat at a different part of the coffee shop.
[36:25.580 --> 36:26.500]  And I went and kind of hid.
[36:26.720 --> 36:27.800]  And I thought, well, close call.
[36:28.480 --> 36:32.220]  And then the next day I went in and he was in the coffee shop.
[36:32.260 --> 36:33.040]  And I thought, that's weird.
[36:33.100 --> 36:36.740]  And so I just left and went to a different coffee shop.
[36:37.140 --> 36:39.380]  And then I thought, well, that's dumb.
[36:39.560 --> 36:42.900]  I'm not going to stop going to a coffee shop because a person who I have no issue with,
[36:42.960 --> 36:45.060]  who I, as far as I know, has no issue with me,
[36:45.400 --> 36:49.960]  is at the same coffee shop who I would probably have a pleasant conversation where we would both
[36:49.960 --> 36:52.020]  go like, hey, have you talked to that friend in a long time?
[36:52.020 --> 36:53.420]  And he'd go, yeah, I saw him recently.
[36:53.440 --> 36:53.860]  How about you?
[36:54.200 --> 36:56.480]  No, we really kind of, we kind of fell off.
[36:56.580 --> 36:57.260]  Oh, that's too sad.
[36:57.340 --> 36:58.340]  Anyway, have a good life.
[36:58.380 --> 36:59.240]  Hope things are going well with you.
[36:59.340 --> 37:00.800]  Like I can hear the conversation in my head.
[37:00.820 --> 37:01.720]  It's totally pleasant.
[37:01.920 --> 37:04.140]  You know, it's just fucking awkward and I don't want to have it.
[37:04.140 --> 37:07.040]  And if I can hear it in my head, why do I have to hear it out of my mouth?
[37:07.260 --> 37:08.580]  You know, I've already had it in my head.
[37:08.720 --> 37:10.520]  I don't have to actually have it now.
[37:11.440 --> 37:14.900]  And so, but I was like, I'm not going to stop going to my coffee shop
[37:14.900 --> 37:17.380]  because of a potentially pleasant conversation.
[37:18.220 --> 37:20.220]  So the next day I go back and he's not there.
[37:20.280 --> 37:20.520]  It's fine.
[37:20.740 --> 37:25.460]  The next time I go back, I get into line and I'm directly behind him.
[37:25.820 --> 37:27.680]  I look up and I'm directly behind him.
[37:27.780 --> 37:31.080]  And I'm like, there's no fucking way that I can avoid this.
[37:31.080 --> 37:36.400]  So I just slowly back up and I just turn around and I sit in a chair
[37:36.400 --> 37:41.040]  and put my head down over my hat down over my eyes and just work on my laptop
[37:42.560 --> 37:45.860]  for 45 minutes until I turn around and I'm like, okay, the coast is clear.
[37:45.960 --> 37:46.820]  And then I go get my coffee.
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.820]  I just figure I'll wait for a while, do the work first, get the coffee later.
[37:50.360 --> 37:58.560]  And then two days ago, I walked in and looked up and he was directly in front of me again.
[37:58.560 --> 38:05.400]  And I thought, this is insane, but I'm not going to be the one to make the call.
[38:05.600 --> 38:08.960]  I'm not going to be the one to initiate the conversation because then I got to thinking,
[38:09.120 --> 38:10.760]  what if he doesn't remember me?
[38:10.840 --> 38:15.640]  Then it's even worse because I've been building this up for weeks, you know?
[38:16.060 --> 38:19.440]  And so I just tried to be like on a pivot.
[38:19.600 --> 38:25.360]  And so anytime he turned right, I slid left and I just stayed behind him
[38:25.360 --> 38:27.720]  the entire time he was in the coffee shop.
[38:27.860 --> 38:29.060]  And I haven't been back since.
[38:29.740 --> 38:32.740]  Do you think he's having the exact same ordeal as you?
[38:33.060 --> 38:33.580]  As a possibility?
[38:34.840 --> 38:36.140]  He's never noticed you once?
[38:37.160 --> 38:41.280]  No, I don't know that he could pick me out of a lineup in 2024,
[38:43.440 --> 38:46.520]  but it's torturous to me and I don't know what to do about it.
[38:46.720 --> 38:49.840]  So is that just what happens after, what do you say, a decade and a half?
[38:50.240 --> 38:52.200]  Probably 15 years, 16 years, somewhere around there.
[38:54.060 --> 38:56.240]  Maybe longer, maybe longer, dude, maybe longer.
[38:56.360 --> 38:58.660]  So you didn't talk to Eric for 16 years?
[38:59.040 --> 39:03.240]  No, if I saw Eric after 16 years, even before all this bullshit,
[39:03.240 --> 39:05.700]  because I've known Eric for a very long time.
[39:05.720 --> 39:07.380]  I've known Eric since the very early days of Rooster Teeth.
[39:08.120 --> 39:11.320]  And if I knew him as the Mega64 guy, if I saw him 16 years later,
[39:11.320 --> 39:14.400]  I would absolutely go up to Eric and say hi to him or any of those dudes.
[39:14.560 --> 39:16.700]  I'd have my hat over my eyes working on my laptop.
[39:16.780 --> 39:18.620]  He would be doing that, but I wouldn't.
[39:18.700 --> 39:20.020]  No, I'd be like, oh, hey, what's up, dude?
[39:20.020 --> 39:22.820]  Because I always got the impression Eric liked me,
[39:23.160 --> 39:25.860]  and we had a friendlier relationship than I've had with this dude.
[39:25.960 --> 39:27.700]  I do. I certainly do like you.
[39:28.120 --> 39:28.560]  Thanks.
[39:28.980 --> 39:33.140]  I think you don't have to talk to this guy or whatever.
[39:33.160 --> 39:34.040]  You don't have to do anything.
[39:34.280 --> 39:36.780]  I think that you're making an obligation for yourself.
[39:36.900 --> 39:39.040]  I think you should keep going, and that should be your spot.
[39:39.420 --> 39:40.200]  That's your place.
[39:41.760 --> 39:43.120]  It's not my spot.
[39:43.240 --> 39:47.180]  It is most definitely his spot, because he knows every barista by name,
[39:47.180 --> 39:50.040]  and they have conversations which take a while,
[39:50.300 --> 39:53.900]  which makes it really hard to try to stay behind him ducking and weaving
[39:53.900 --> 39:56.640]  while he's animated and having a long conversation with a dude
[39:56.640 --> 39:58.540]  whose first and last name he seems to know.
[39:58.600 --> 40:00.420]  It's his place, not mine.
[40:01.220 --> 40:02.540]  That's definitely his space.
[40:02.620 --> 40:02.860]  You're right.
[40:02.960 --> 40:06.000]  I think you gotta go somewhere else.
[40:06.180 --> 40:06.640]  I think you gotta.
[40:07.360 --> 40:08.620]  Well, that's what I've been doing.
[40:08.960 --> 40:11.000]  Every time I come back, I go...
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.060]  Every time I come back, I run into the motherfucker.
[40:13.360 --> 40:15.780]  I even decided to go earlier one day.
[40:15.780 --> 40:19.820]  I went two hours earlier, and it was one of the days I almost walked into him.
[40:19.900 --> 40:20.700]  I was right behind him.
[40:22.060 --> 40:22.720]  That's awesome.
[40:23.040 --> 40:25.640]  Really funny twist of it turns out he works there.
[40:27.800 --> 40:29.820]  Yeah, he's like the night shift guy.
[40:32.780 --> 40:33.640]  That's funny, Andrew.
[40:33.660 --> 40:35.780]  I had kind of forgotten about that as content.
[40:36.040 --> 40:39.640]  If you work at a coffee shop, though, you don't walk out from behind the counter
[40:39.640 --> 40:40.520]  and get in line, do you?
[40:40.720 --> 40:42.640]  To talk to people and order a coffee.
[40:44.020 --> 40:46.460]  And then ask them what tacos they have left.
[40:48.020 --> 40:49.620]  You just sold the last taco.
[40:49.740 --> 40:50.160]  You know what I mean.
[40:50.160 --> 40:53.620]  You sell the tacos, then you go around to the front of the counter and make someone
[40:53.620 --> 40:54.980]  tell you what tacos you have left.
[40:56.140 --> 40:57.540]  Oh, man, we're out of stock.
[40:57.800 --> 40:58.200]  Fuck.
[40:58.720 --> 40:59.640]  God damn it.
[41:00.260 --> 41:01.180]  Hey, it's Paris.
[41:01.720 --> 41:03.860]  You know, I love sparkly things, right?
[41:03.880 --> 41:04.880]  Like stars.
[41:05.360 --> 41:05.600]  Duh.
[41:06.080 --> 41:09.720]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[41:09.720 --> 41:14.640]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,
[41:15.100 --> 41:19.340]  making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop.
[41:20.020 --> 41:22.380]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.

[41:59.360 --> 42:03.600]  Speaking of stuff we have talked about off camera that should make its way
[42:03.600 --> 42:07.420]  on camera at some point, do you guys think we should talk about potato range?
[42:08.200 --> 42:08.760]  Yeah.
[42:08.760 --> 42:09.620]  Of course.
[42:10.420 --> 42:10.940]  Potato range.
[42:11.820 --> 42:14.700]  Was when you were having potato chips for breakfast
[42:14.700 --> 42:18.180]  and Nick told you that was not an appropriate time to eat potatoes.
[42:18.680 --> 42:21.160]  And then we were like, but what about hash browns?
[42:21.160 --> 42:25.480]  And then we realized that there is a range throughout the day
[42:25.480 --> 42:28.840]  when it's appropriate to eat certain types of potato
[42:29.560 --> 42:31.920]  and inappropriate to eat other types of potato.
[42:32.220 --> 42:34.660]  And we wanted to explore that a little bit.
[42:35.020 --> 42:36.140]  Potato range is vast.
[42:36.140 --> 42:40.440]  Yeah. Weren't we going to like take each meal of the day and file the potatoes into each one?
[42:40.940 --> 42:42.260]  Yeah. Like breakfast, lunch, dinner.
[42:42.720 --> 42:43.120]  Yeah.
[42:43.200 --> 42:47.040]  The idea being that it's the same ingredient, but it's prepared differently
[42:47.040 --> 42:51.140]  and how it's prepared shifts when it is appropriate to eat said thing.
[42:51.520 --> 42:55.280]  Like a hash brown is only appropriate for breakfast.
[42:55.820 --> 42:58.400]  But if someone gave you like mashed potato and gravy for breakfast,
[42:58.420 --> 42:59.620]  you'd be like, oh, a bit heavy.
[42:59.700 --> 43:02.420]  That is the wrong time of day to eat that kind of potato.
[43:02.420 --> 43:06.880]  Right. I would even argue like mashed potato and gravy is only appropriate at dinner.
[43:07.240 --> 43:09.340]  Nobody's having mashed potatoes at lunch.
[43:10.140 --> 43:13.780]  What if you had like a fat, like a chicken pot pie or something that came with a bit of mash?
[43:14.220 --> 43:17.040]  I guess. It feels like a dinner food to me. It really does.
[43:17.860 --> 43:21.600]  But like French fries feel like dinner and lunch.
[43:21.700 --> 43:24.380]  Is there a potato that crosses all three meals?
[43:26.400 --> 43:30.300]  What's the type of potato where you use the foil and it's like sliced potato?
[43:31.140 --> 43:31.580]  Baked?
[43:32.660 --> 43:33.360]  Au gratin?
[43:33.640 --> 43:34.080]  Yeah.
[43:35.040 --> 43:38.420]  Au gratin would not be a breakfast potato, I wouldn't think.
[43:38.980 --> 43:41.000]  That's another one I would only think for dinner.
[43:41.760 --> 43:46.120]  I feel like if you had to have it for breakfast, it would work.
[43:46.880 --> 43:48.300]  It could. It could. Maybe.
[43:49.740 --> 43:50.620]  Or maybe...
[43:50.620 --> 43:51.840]  You could have most potatoes for breakfast if you had to.
[43:52.560 --> 43:55.600]  But do people have like potato pancakes, right? Potato cakes?
[43:55.740 --> 43:55.900]  Yeah.
[43:56.220 --> 43:57.820]  Yeah. Oh, those are so good.
[43:57.980 --> 43:58.940]  Homestyle potatoes.
[43:59.760 --> 44:00.560]  Homestyle potatoes.
[44:01.120 --> 44:06.120]  Like these immediately? What meal do you eat these with?
[44:06.440 --> 44:07.160]  Only breakfast.
[44:07.380 --> 44:09.980]  It's breakfast, but I think you could do them...
[44:10.440 --> 44:15.060]  I think you can do them up and then they're not just breakfast and you don't have to do much.
[44:15.140 --> 44:18.080]  And all of a sudden, that's a dinner side. You can have that for lunch.
[44:18.460 --> 44:21.560]  You're right. It's about how you dress it, I think.
[44:21.560 --> 44:23.080]  I agree. I think that's what it is.
[44:23.160 --> 44:25.780]  What's funny about the top one, though, is that it's all like,
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.240]  I assume, chopped up first and then cooked.
[44:28.940 --> 44:31.440]  But if you just cook it the same way without chopping it up,
[44:31.780 --> 44:33.060]  it's much more of a dinner potato.
[44:34.320 --> 44:35.200]  That's interesting.
[44:35.700 --> 44:37.980]  So even like the time of slicing effects.
[44:39.380 --> 44:40.920]  It's tough. It's tough.
[44:42.440 --> 44:44.260]  Would you ever have a baked...
[44:44.260 --> 44:46.980]  Could you ever see a baked potato as a breakfast food?
[44:47.020 --> 44:48.980]  Because it's got chives, bacon...
[44:48.980 --> 44:51.120]  We gotta try it. We have to try it.
[44:51.300 --> 44:52.080]  We gotta have a...
[44:52.080 --> 44:54.360]  We have to have a baked potato for breakfast.
[44:54.560 --> 44:56.000]  A breakfast baked potato, right?
[44:56.440 --> 44:57.900]  Oh, what's on them?
[44:57.900 --> 44:59.620]  But I think it needs to.
[44:59.840 --> 45:01.680]  We need to invent the bacon on it.
[45:02.360 --> 45:03.600]  Oh, it's gotta have bacon.
[45:03.940 --> 45:05.560]  Instead of bacon bits, it's got bacon.
[45:06.580 --> 45:10.000]  Big old jacket potatoes you sometimes in England will put baked beans in them,
[45:10.240 --> 45:12.380]  which is typically a breakfast food.
[45:12.400 --> 45:14.240]  But I've never had that for breakfast.
[45:14.940 --> 45:16.780]  So a baked potato with beans in it?
[45:17.260 --> 45:17.720]  Yeah.
[45:17.980 --> 45:19.040]  I like that.
[45:19.520 --> 45:20.940]  It's not bad. I've had that recently.
[45:20.960 --> 45:22.900]  Like, it becomes like a little bean boat.
[45:23.500 --> 45:23.640]  Yeah.
[45:24.080 --> 45:26.300]  Are baked beans considered a breakfast food?
[45:27.000 --> 45:27.380]  In England.
[45:27.820 --> 45:29.760]  I mean, it's part of the full English, typically.
[45:30.060 --> 45:31.680]  You can have them any time, though.
[45:32.260 --> 45:34.060]  I just associate them with breakfast much more.
[45:34.100 --> 45:36.100]  Yeah, I was gonna say, I view them more as a dinner, personally.
[45:37.020 --> 45:37.400]  Oh, really?
[45:38.260 --> 45:39.540]  Yeah, like a dinner side.
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.720]  I feel like you need some good shredded cheese on a baked potato.
[45:43.960 --> 45:44.420]  Oh, yeah, you need some cheese.
[45:44.420 --> 45:46.320]  And that fits for breakfast or for lunch, right?
[45:46.400 --> 45:47.740]  Like, cheese is a big part of breakfast.
[45:48.240 --> 45:48.960]  A runny egg.
[45:49.780 --> 45:50.500]  Runny egg.
[45:51.820 --> 45:52.480]  Runny egg.
[45:53.720 --> 45:55.460]  Eric, you want to throw anything in the mix?
[45:56.500 --> 46:00.240]  Uh, no, I feel like, I mean, like, runny egg, you got bacon.
[46:01.800 --> 46:04.060]  What else can, like, I'm thinking of, like, garnish.
[46:05.540 --> 46:08.100]  Right, right. Like, jalapeno or something?
[46:09.600 --> 46:14.240]  What about, like, on that first picture that I sent of the homestyle potato,
[46:14.900 --> 46:19.060]  with that is, like, little diced onion that's kind of, like, fried, diced, like,
[46:19.560 --> 46:21.080]  that kind of onion.
[46:21.320 --> 46:24.860]  Like, I think that would be, like, very small, kind of tossed on top,
[46:24.860 --> 46:25.840]  I think would be very nice.
[46:26.000 --> 46:27.180]  Diced and fried onion.
[46:27.460 --> 46:28.500]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:28.520 --> 46:29.780]  Love that. So here's what we have.
[46:29.880 --> 46:32.100]  We have our breakfast baked potato right now.
[46:32.240 --> 46:33.680]  It's got beans in it.
[46:33.940 --> 46:35.320]  It's got full bacon.
[46:35.440 --> 46:36.600]  It's got cheese.
[46:36.820 --> 46:40.660]  It's got runny egg and diced and fried onions.
[46:41.020 --> 46:42.160]  I just found a recipe.
[46:42.420 --> 46:42.840]  It's going to kill a bat.
[46:42.880 --> 46:43.800]  These look so good.
[46:44.440 --> 46:47.940]  Twice baked breakfast potatoes is the recipe for this sandwich.
[46:48.540 --> 46:49.140]  Oh, that's good.
[46:49.340 --> 46:50.120]  Oh, I just had...
[46:50.120 --> 46:52.440]  Oh, because it's baked again for the egg?
[46:52.720 --> 46:53.940]  Yeah, there you go. That's just about right.
[46:53.940 --> 46:54.640]  That looks great.
[46:55.200 --> 46:56.680]  That's exactly what we want.
[46:56.880 --> 47:00.260]  I mean, a twice baked potato is essentially, you know, you bake the potato,
[47:00.400 --> 47:02.540]  you hollow it out, you make like a mashed potato with it,
[47:02.560 --> 47:04.700]  you put it back in and re-cook it.
[47:04.720 --> 47:08.520]  Do you guys think the potato is the most versatile of foods?
[47:09.560 --> 47:11.280]  It's probably up there, yeah.
[47:11.400 --> 47:14.160]  Right? Because I was sitting here thinking, like, this is such a great segment,
[47:14.560 --> 47:16.500]  and in the back of my head, I've been trying to figure out
[47:16.500 --> 47:19.220]  what else we would apply this to that could span three meals.
[47:19.300 --> 47:23.120]  And it's hard to find something else that is as much of a Swiss army,
[47:23.120 --> 47:25.760]  like a culinary Swiss army knife as potato.
[47:26.100 --> 47:28.280]  Could you sous vide a potato?
[47:30.120 --> 47:31.120]  100%. 100%.
[47:31.760 --> 47:33.640]  It'd be like the best baked potato ever.
[47:35.800 --> 47:37.380]  A little, like, vacuum bag.
[47:40.240 --> 47:45.300]  We should, when we make our regulation breakfast baked potato, we should sous vide them.
[47:45.760 --> 47:49.340]  Yeah, we should all potentially bring in a new format for potatoes,
[47:49.420 --> 47:52.440]  as well as our rankings for potato meals.
[47:54.920 --> 47:56.340]  Interesting. A new format.
[47:57.560 --> 48:01.500]  I wonder if you could have those twice-baked potatoes,
[48:02.040 --> 48:06.060]  if you could just recombine the halves and make the best single potato.
[48:06.380 --> 48:07.440]  You could re-potato?
[48:07.880 --> 48:08.260]  Yeah.
[48:09.160 --> 48:12.120]  Oh, I just had an idea. I don't want to spoil it. I just had an idea for what I want to do.
[48:12.820 --> 48:13.760]  Re-potatoed beans?
[48:14.300 --> 48:16.860]  No, no. It's not.
[48:18.600 --> 48:21.940]  When are we doing this? When are we going to present our ideas and stuff?
[48:21.940 --> 48:23.500]  Are we entering a spud era?
[48:23.920 --> 48:24.760]  Are we entering a... yeah.
[48:26.560 --> 48:28.940]  I'm going to need some time in the lab, I think, to come up with mine.
[48:29.320 --> 48:32.280]  Yeah, I think I'm going to need a little bit of lab time as well.
[48:32.840 --> 48:35.640]  Maybe we'll revisit this idea in the next episode.
[48:36.200 --> 48:40.380]  I do think we still need to have our potato draft. We've been discussing that for a while,
[48:40.580 --> 48:43.260]  and I think we were going to try to get Gracie in that one if we can, hopefully.
[48:43.960 --> 48:46.940]  But in addition to that, we've got to put it on the books.
[48:46.940 --> 48:51.940]  Breakfast baked potato. We'll get into the flavor lab and we'll make something happen,
[48:52.040 --> 48:55.400]  and then we can all come up with our own new potato inventions as well.
[48:56.220 --> 48:56.700]  I love it.
[48:57.200 --> 48:59.700]  I think that is a fantastic idea.
[49:00.480 --> 49:06.040]  Can you think of the quickest you destroyed an item that you bought?
[49:06.860 --> 49:15.740]  I bought a computer once with Gus, and I bought some RAM, and he was showing me how to do it.
[49:15.740 --> 49:21.560]  And somehow I flipped the RAM around backwards, but I was still able to jam it in,
[49:21.600 --> 49:23.160]  even though it didn't fit.
[49:23.640 --> 49:25.460]  And Gus said it was one of the most impressive things he'd ever seen,
[49:25.620 --> 49:28.080]  and that fucked my motherboard and the RAM up instantly.
[49:28.340 --> 49:30.800]  That's crazy, because they're usually like keyed a certain way.
[49:30.880 --> 49:34.620]  Yeah, it was keyed a certain way. Yeah, it was like off balance. It shouldn't have fit.
[49:34.760 --> 49:36.700]  Yeah, he was pretty blown away too.
[49:37.300 --> 49:38.620]  Mine also involves keying.
[49:38.620 --> 49:46.260]  Uh, I bought some stuff from the Home Depot, and I need a padlock, so I bought one.
[49:46.500 --> 49:50.020]  A lot of the time, if I'm getting an Uber or something, I'll just take all the stuff
[49:50.020 --> 49:52.280]  out of the packaging when I walk out of the store and just throw it away,
[49:52.720 --> 49:54.420]  so I'm not having to throw it away at home.
[49:54.760 --> 49:59.000]  And on the way home in the Uber, I managed to padlock the keys to the padlock.
[50:00.580 --> 50:01.560]  Like, on the loop.
[50:02.680 --> 50:04.780]  And I got home and I was like, I can't undo this.
[50:07.960 --> 50:09.220]  I'm just fiddling.
[50:10.720 --> 50:12.880]  Have you picked your lock yet to get your keys?
[50:16.220 --> 50:22.540]  It was a few years ago, but the other day I found the padlock with the two keys on the hoop.
[50:24.640 --> 50:26.140]  That's fucking awesome.
[50:28.040 --> 50:29.220]  Such a waste of money.
[50:30.760 --> 50:31.480]  Oh, man.
[50:31.920 --> 50:34.400]  I'd love to see a photo at some point, if you find it.
[50:34.400 --> 50:35.720]  Yeah, I should have taken a picture of it.
[50:36.180 --> 50:36.900]  Oh, man.
[50:37.580 --> 50:38.020]  Oh, man.
[50:38.140 --> 50:40.740]  Speaking of a waste of money, I finished Terminator Salvation.
[50:41.080 --> 50:43.080]  What a waste of money that was.
[50:43.760 --> 50:45.620]  I know you guys don't remember it because it was a million years ago,
[50:45.640 --> 50:46.600]  but that movie's a real piece of shit.
[50:46.760 --> 50:50.560]  It ends with a robot giving Christian Bale a heart.
[50:51.420 --> 50:52.040]  Oh, right.
[50:52.220 --> 50:52.360]  What?
[50:52.500 --> 50:53.400]  In the middle of the fucking...
[50:53.400 --> 50:54.120]  Like, on the battlefield.
[50:54.480 --> 50:54.720]  I don't remember it.
[50:54.740 --> 50:56.080]  Yeah, and he's like, you can have my heart.
[50:56.420 --> 50:58.160]  And it's like, yeah, that'll work, sure.
[50:58.660 --> 50:59.940]  His heart's bad, so we'll just...
[50:59.940 --> 51:00.800]  Yeah, open heart, sir.
[51:00.880 --> 51:01.440]  Yeah, it's no problem.
[51:01.480 --> 51:02.100]  It's the future, right?
[51:02.100 --> 51:06.400]  But I have been, you know, I'm in my entertainment era
[51:06.400 --> 51:08.980]  now that I'm ignoring the news and the world at large.
[51:09.360 --> 51:12.720]  I have discovered a new television show and I liked it quite a bit
[51:12.720 --> 51:14.660]  and I wanted to tell you guys about it in case you haven't seen it yet.
[51:14.800 --> 51:19.160]  Are you guys familiar with Interior Chinatown?
[51:19.860 --> 51:20.120]  No.
[51:20.500 --> 51:20.840]  No.
[51:21.400 --> 51:22.400]  It is on Hulu.
[51:22.900 --> 51:23.760]  You guys should check it out.
[51:23.860 --> 51:24.960]  It's very funny.
[51:25.500 --> 51:26.060]  Taika Waititi.
[51:26.460 --> 51:28.940]  It's not a Taika Waititi film, but he's one of the producers
[51:28.940 --> 51:30.220]  and I think he directed the first episode.
[51:31.040 --> 51:32.860]  And it's just about these dudes that...
[51:34.580 --> 51:38.240]  I don't want to spoil it because the whole premise of the show is kind of the charm,
[51:39.080 --> 51:42.860]  but it's just about some guys who feel like they're background characters
[51:42.860 --> 51:46.360]  in other people's lives and they just, like, work at a Chinese restaurant and...
[51:46.360 --> 51:46.660]  I see.
[51:47.120 --> 51:49.000]  It's just, it's very funny and very clever.
[51:49.080 --> 51:51.740]  And it's got Ronny Chieng in it, who I like quite a bit from The Daily Show.
[51:51.980 --> 51:53.540]  It's him and Jimmy O. Yang, right?
[51:53.680 --> 51:54.700]  Yeah, Jimmy O. Yang's in it as well.
[51:54.740 --> 51:55.500]  He's like the main character.
[51:55.660 --> 51:55.780]  Yeah.
[51:56.180 --> 51:56.640]  That's cool.
[51:56.780 --> 51:57.700]  I've seen the previews for it.
[51:57.720 --> 51:58.840]  I thought it looked really interesting.
[51:58.840 --> 52:01.060]  It looks really, like, off the wall.
[52:01.420 --> 52:03.020]  It's very off the wall.
[52:03.560 --> 52:06.700]  And after I watched it and then I saw that Taika Waititi directed it, I was like,
[52:06.760 --> 52:09.540]  oh, OK, that makes sense because it feels very much like that.
[52:09.640 --> 52:11.000]  I don't know that the premise will last...
[52:11.000 --> 52:11.660]  It's like 10 episodes.
[52:11.740 --> 52:15.320]  I don't know that the premise will hold throughout, but the first episode was great.
[52:16.400 --> 52:16.680]  Cool.
[52:17.120 --> 52:17.940]  So that's my recommendation.
[52:18.840 --> 52:19.200]  That's fun.
[52:19.240 --> 52:22.740]  I recently watched season 10 of Love Island UK,
[52:23.080 --> 52:27.900]  and I'm convinced that if you cut out every time they said,
[52:27.900 --> 52:30.700]  bro, obviously, do you know what I mean?
[52:31.240 --> 52:34.120]  Or at the end of the day, there'd be like 20 less episodes.
[52:34.900 --> 52:40.180]  What if, like, 17 seasons into Love Island, they introduce the smoke monster?
[52:40.920 --> 52:43.520]  What if it just slowly turns into the island from Lost?
[52:44.080 --> 52:45.040]  That would be so cool.
[52:45.080 --> 52:47.920]  They have to put the numbers into a computer on Love Island.
[52:48.500 --> 52:48.880]  That would be...
[52:48.880 --> 52:49.860]  Desmond's there.
[52:50.000 --> 52:50.880]  Oh, hell yeah.
[52:51.380 --> 52:52.440]  Hey, guys, I'll be right back.
[52:52.500 --> 52:53.780]  I'm going to go get my Starbucks.
[52:55.260 --> 52:56.140]  Oh, awesome.
[52:56.140 --> 52:58.000]  What a way to end this episode.
[52:58.100 --> 52:58.800]  This rocks.
[52:58.880 --> 52:59.760]  This is so cool.
[53:00.120 --> 53:03.000]  What other shows should have Lost in them?
[53:03.280 --> 53:06.960]  I think Love Island should just put a hatch in the ground of the next season and see if
[53:06.960 --> 53:07.740]  anyone notices it.
[53:08.080 --> 53:08.220]  Yeah.
[53:08.320 --> 53:12.160]  Well, they open the hatch and the light comes out big style, and it's like, oh, that was
[53:12.160 --> 53:12.700]  like the best.
[53:12.900 --> 53:13.540]  That was so cool.
[53:14.060 --> 53:14.500]  Hell yeah.
[53:14.780 --> 53:15.820]  I think this is a great...
[53:15.820 --> 53:17.420]  That would make me watch Love Island.
[53:18.020 --> 53:20.280]  If all of a sudden it's like, well, no, it's like Lost.
[53:20.440 --> 53:22.500]  I would be like, oh shit, I got to watch this, I think.
[53:22.900 --> 53:23.580]  That would be sick.
[53:23.580 --> 53:32.920]  There was a show called Siberia, I think, on the Syfy channel, and the premise was survivor
[53:32.920 --> 53:38.800]  meets Lost, and it was terrible, but I like the idea of it a lot where it's like they're
[53:38.800 --> 53:43.780]  filming a survivor based reality show in the woods, but then a smoke monster appears
[53:43.780 --> 53:44.640]  and it just...
[53:44.640 --> 53:45.260]  Oh, here we go.
[53:45.400 --> 53:46.120]  Oh, Jeff's live.
[53:46.200 --> 53:47.060]  Guys, Jeff is here.
[53:47.120 --> 53:48.300]  Nick, you got to record this.
[53:48.320 --> 53:48.920]  Oh, hold on.
[53:49.080 --> 53:49.500]  Let's see.
[53:50.040 --> 53:53.320]  Uh, hello, boys.
[53:53.600 --> 53:53.960]  Hello.
[53:54.240 --> 53:54.820]  Cool hat.
[53:54.820 --> 53:55.300]  Cool hat, by the way.
[53:55.320 --> 53:56.100]  That's what I said.
[53:56.200 --> 53:56.380]  Oh, thank you.
[53:56.460 --> 53:56.980]  Thank you very much.
[53:57.020 --> 53:58.440]  Andrew complimented the other day.
[53:58.440 --> 53:58.920]  It's great.
[53:59.200 --> 54:01.460]  It's that fashion show I went out of town for.
[54:01.820 --> 54:02.580]  Those fat ladies.
[54:03.700 --> 54:04.440]  All right, here we go.
[54:05.780 --> 54:08.940]  So how does it look in terms of cranberries?
[54:10.140 --> 54:12.200]  So I ordered extra cranberries.
[54:12.340 --> 54:13.700]  I paid an extra 98 cents.
[54:14.640 --> 54:15.980]  That's extra cranberries.
[54:16.380 --> 54:17.400]  Oh, there we go.
[54:18.140 --> 54:20.860]  I got a bunch right against the wall here.
[54:20.880 --> 54:22.240]  I don't see them anywhere else.
[54:24.740 --> 54:26.260]  It's like they're trying to escape
[54:26.260 --> 54:28.100]  by climbing on top of each other.
[54:29.140 --> 54:30.320]  Okay, I'm just accessible.
[54:30.660 --> 54:31.640]  I'm just going to take a drink.
[54:31.700 --> 54:32.380]  So this is like a lemonade.
[54:32.640 --> 54:33.180]  I don't even know what I want.
[54:33.320 --> 54:35.840]  Yeah, it's it's got some warm spices in it.
[54:35.860 --> 54:38.920]  So you got kind of the seasonal kick with it as well.
[54:39.720 --> 54:40.620]  Oh, it's real good.
[54:40.780 --> 54:41.620]  Oh, he likes it.
[54:41.620 --> 54:42.560]  It's real good.
[54:42.720 --> 54:43.620]  He really likes it.
[54:43.660 --> 54:45.720]  But wait until he starts chewing down on these cranberries.
[54:45.760 --> 54:46.720]  He's going to love it, right?
[54:47.780 --> 54:48.940]  Boys, that's flavor.
[54:49.320 --> 54:50.180]  That's real good.
[54:50.420 --> 54:52.200]  That's real fucking good right there.
[54:52.360 --> 54:54.840]  This is not an ad for Starbucks or anything, but Jesus Christ.
[54:56.740 --> 54:59.300]  I want to get a cranberry reaction is what I need.
[54:59.300 --> 55:01.420]  Okay, so now you know the flavor.
[55:01.820 --> 55:04.580]  Does it taste like cranberries as a as a taste?
[55:05.080 --> 55:07.920]  Yeah, it's like a like a ocean spray kind of flavor.
[55:08.100 --> 55:08.280]  Cool.
[55:08.720 --> 55:10.520]  So here's the cranberry in question.
[55:10.680 --> 55:12.240]  It's sliced, as Andrew said.
[55:12.540 --> 55:13.500]  It looks almost like a cherry.
[55:22.590 --> 55:23.210]  That's fine.
[55:23.210 --> 55:24.310]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[55:25.450 --> 55:26.130]  Tastes like food.
[55:26.270 --> 55:26.730]  It's eatable.
[55:27.210 --> 55:27.530]  I'm going to eat this.
[55:27.550 --> 55:28.190]  Tastes like a cranberry.
[55:28.350 --> 55:28.630]  It's edible.
[55:28.910 --> 55:31.530]  Yeah, but what if what if more is better?
[55:31.630 --> 55:33.130]  What if you had a whole handful at once?
[55:33.450 --> 55:33.810]  Yeah.
[55:33.910 --> 55:35.170]  What if you need a bunch?
[55:35.230 --> 55:38.030]  Because you're only getting you're going to eat one whole cranberry that way.
[55:38.070 --> 55:38.610]  You know what I mean?
[55:38.910 --> 55:40.370]  You have a cran as many as I.
[55:40.610 --> 55:42.110]  Yeah, have a have a fist of cran.
[55:43.450 --> 55:44.090]  This is most.
[55:44.330 --> 55:45.530]  This is most of them.
[55:46.010 --> 55:46.530]  Fist of cran.
[55:46.830 --> 55:47.810]  I don't know if you can see here.
[55:50.310 --> 55:51.630]  Oh, that's so many.
[55:52.070 --> 55:52.630]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[55:52.630 --> 55:54.290]  OK, OK, OK.
[55:55.970 --> 55:57.490]  Oh, it's going to be so sour.
[55:59.670 --> 56:02.010]  Oh, like a fucking murder scene over here.
[56:09.660 --> 56:12.840]  It's definitely not the best part of the drink, but it's totally fine.
[56:16.060 --> 56:18.220]  OK, I feel less bad about eating them now.
[56:18.560 --> 56:24.220]  I don't think Gavin's Gavin's right.
[56:24.340 --> 56:26.660]  They're definitely edible and they wouldn't put them in if they weren't.
[56:26.800 --> 56:28.780]  But I don't know that you're intended to eat it.
[56:28.860 --> 56:30.540]  I think it's supposed to be more like a lemon.
[56:31.060 --> 56:32.760]  That's the essence of it.
[56:33.440 --> 56:35.960]  The cherry at the bottom of a root 44.
[56:38.340 --> 56:40.000]  But it's not bad.
[56:40.160 --> 56:44.660]  And I actually thought that they were pretty yummy, like not the best or anything.
[56:44.780 --> 56:46.720]  But they weren't hard to eat or anything.
[56:47.580 --> 56:47.720]  So.
[56:48.780 --> 56:48.980]  Cheers.
[56:49.800 --> 56:50.220]  Cheers.
[56:51.680 --> 56:52.820]  That's great, Jeff.
[56:52.880 --> 56:53.460]  What a way.
[56:53.780 --> 56:54.800]  What a way to do that.
[56:54.880 --> 56:56.360]  What a way to end it for us, too.
[56:56.360 --> 56:58.340]  That was that was a fun one.
[56:58.420 --> 57:00.080]  Very food centric.
[57:00.480 --> 57:02.900]  Jeff was a little rascal.
[57:03.460 --> 57:04.480]  This was exciting.
[57:04.840 --> 57:07.220]  This was this was a really fun one.
[57:07.320 --> 57:09.180]  Why don't you who wants to do the cool outro?
[57:09.800 --> 57:11.560]  Oh, I think Andrew has the biggest beard.
[57:14.180 --> 57:15.960]  I don't have a beard anymore.
[57:16.940 --> 57:18.240]  I can just say whatever I wanted.
[57:22.860 --> 57:26.060]  I can't imagine how big Andrew's beard is at this point.
[57:26.060 --> 57:27.640]  It's about the same.
[57:28.380 --> 57:30.400]  Same as what?
[57:30.640 --> 57:31.660]  The same as what?
[57:32.080 --> 57:33.020]  Last time I checked.
[57:34.240 --> 57:35.440]  This sucks.
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.200]  Well, there you have it.
[57:38.560 --> 57:43.600]  Andrew's beard is exactly the same as the last time he checked.
[57:43.900 --> 57:45.400]  How's your beard doing?
[57:45.900 --> 57:47.200]  Do you have one?
[57:47.340 --> 57:48.600]  What length is it?
[57:48.920 --> 57:51.000]  Has it grown since you looked at it?
[57:51.380 --> 57:54.620]  Let us know over there at the Patreon.
[57:55.380 --> 57:58.420]  Andrew's going to hit you with the Patreon domain real fast.
[57:59.700 --> 58:00.860]  RegulationPod on Patreon.
[58:01.920 --> 58:02.340]  All right.
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.340]  And go there if you want the RegulationPod on Patreon.
[58:06.740 --> 58:06.780]  What?
[58:07.280 --> 58:07.560]  What?
[58:07.700 --> 58:09.920]  It's just the way I mean, you could just give the URL.
[58:10.060 --> 58:12.060]  It's what you were doing with Twitch the other day,
[58:12.060 --> 58:14.340]  where you were just like the RegulationPod at Twitch.
[58:14.340 --> 58:16.920]  And it's like, just say twitch.tv slash the RegulationPod.
[58:17.100 --> 58:18.080]  Like, give the URL.
[58:18.760 --> 58:21.080]  You see, Andrew, there's a spirit to it.
[58:21.360 --> 58:22.020]  I agree.
[58:22.760 --> 58:27.220]  I've recorded like 60 segments in the past two days.
[58:27.360 --> 58:28.340]  I'm a little, I'm a little gone.
[58:28.440 --> 58:28.800]  I'm a little tired.
[58:28.880 --> 58:29.240]  I apologize.
[58:30.520 --> 58:32.120]  No apology necessary.
[58:32.400 --> 58:32.680]  Keep it on fire.
[58:32.760 --> 58:34.180]  We hope you enjoyed the episode.
[58:34.340 --> 58:36.980]  We do hope you'll check out that Patreon Andrew mentioned.
[58:37.100 --> 58:38.960]  Also, don't forget, we are on YouTube.
[58:39.320 --> 58:42.660]  If you go down there, you can check out our regulation gameplays,
[58:42.660 --> 58:44.620]  as well as the video versions of these podcasts.
[58:44.620 --> 58:48.320]  They have images of some of the things that we talk about sometimes.
[58:49.500 --> 58:51.120]  And we'll be right here next week.
[58:51.120 --> 58:52.120]  Hopefully you'll see us.
[58:52.280 --> 58:53.980]  We'll talk about something really fun and exciting.
[58:54.120 --> 58:58.980]  Like, uh, what's something fun and exciting we could talk about?
[58:59.100 --> 59:00.560]  Hey, you know, it'd be really crazy, Jeff.
[59:00.920 --> 59:01.600]  What's that, Andrew?
[59:02.340 --> 59:05.540]  Imagine if you took all the audio feeds of a podcast,
[59:05.620 --> 59:07.180]  then line them up and played them.
[59:07.340 --> 59:08.120]  That'd be crazy.
[59:09.400 --> 59:10.260]  I think I might do that.
[59:11.540 --> 59:13.480]  You know, it's like when if you're going to make a trail mix,
[59:13.540 --> 59:16.780]  so you get each item individually and then you put them together to see how they look.
[59:16.840 --> 59:20.720]  Like, what if we what if we took all the individual audio tracks and line them up?
[59:21.480 --> 59:23.460]  That's absolutely what if.
[59:23.540 --> 59:24.740]  That's a great idea, Andrew.
[59:24.840 --> 59:26.540]  And while you're trying that, think about this.
[59:26.660 --> 59:30.140]  What if you could only wear clothes you buy at the airport?
[59:30.400 --> 59:32.220]  What would your outfits look like?
[59:32.520 --> 59:33.420]  Who would you be?
[59:33.500 --> 59:34.320]  We'll see you next week.
[59:34.400 --> 59:35.040]  Bye-bye.
[59:35.400 --> 59:35.820]  Bye.
[59:36.020 --> 59:36.380]  Bye.
