[00:07.000 --> 00:10.780]  It's everything you've loved about every family vacation you've ever been on,

[00:14.520 --> 00:19.520]  seven onboard pools for every level of chill, more than 40 ways to dine and drink,
[00:19.660 --> 00:24.280]  and even more to enjoy at our award-winning private island, Perfect Day at Coco Cay.

[00:30.120 --> 00:34.240]  Hello and welcome to another episode of The Regulation Podcast. This is number
[00:34.800 --> 00:38.600]  38. It's got to be closing in on about our 250th episode or so,
[00:39.080 --> 00:43.420]  if you consider the old failed company we were a part of. And my name is Jeff Renzi. With me,
[00:43.440 --> 00:46.680]  as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz, Eric Baddour.
[00:47.240 --> 00:51.780]  I guess if a company does get shut down, it technically is failed, right? Like, I feel like
[00:52.460 --> 00:54.060]  20... what? 21 years?
[00:54.640 --> 00:58.140]  That's like saying when someone dies at age 95, they failed.
[00:58.600 --> 01:01.280]  They do say that. They do say that. They say, oh, his heart failed.
[01:01.780 --> 01:02.780]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[01:02.860 --> 01:07.420]  I have a friend who says if you don't live to 100, you don't live a full life. Like,
[01:07.420 --> 01:12.240]  Prince Philip died at 99. And the first text that I got from my friend Andrew Douglas was
[01:12.640 --> 01:15.320]  so close to a full life, man. What a bummer.
[01:16.380 --> 01:18.160]  Barely, as well. Almost made it.
[01:18.720 --> 01:19.480]  Oh, she was close.
[01:20.120 --> 01:24.460]  I like the idea of Nick having to sync our audio whenever we do a countdown.
[01:25.740 --> 01:27.800]  I like the idea of the second one.
[01:28.020 --> 01:28.760]  He's got to re-sync it.
[01:29.060 --> 01:30.880]  Because he's going to try and sync again.
[01:31.400 --> 01:32.560]  I have a question for you, Gavin.
[01:33.100 --> 01:33.500]  Okay.
[01:34.040 --> 01:35.000]  When's a year old?
[01:36.180 --> 01:37.460]  When is a year old?
[01:37.600 --> 01:40.300]  When is a year old? When does a year become old?
[01:41.140 --> 01:41.640]  When does a...
[01:41.640 --> 01:44.340]  You followed me on the blue sky a little while back.
[01:45.120 --> 01:47.600]  And I went, oh, Gavin, your profile. And I opened your profile.
[01:47.980 --> 01:49.600]  You had one post that said, happy new year.
[01:49.820 --> 01:51.880]  And it made me wonder, when does a year become old?
[01:53.100 --> 01:53.540]  Uh...
[01:53.540 --> 01:56.540]  We get a new year every year. At what point is it an old year?
[01:56.600 --> 01:58.500]  Certainly last year is an old year.
[01:59.060 --> 02:01.240]  Are you saying, like, when is the year itself old?
[02:01.260 --> 02:02.840]  Or when can you stop saying happy new year?
[02:03.080 --> 02:04.600]  I'm saying, when does the year itself become old?
[02:04.660 --> 02:07.020]  Are you saying, Geoff, that last year is old year?
[02:07.440 --> 02:09.360]  Yeah. It's becoming older every day.
[02:09.900 --> 02:10.700]  That is true.
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  2023 is old. For sure.
[02:13.340 --> 02:15.540]  There's some stuff in 2024 that isn't old yet.
[02:15.800 --> 02:19.600]  But I'd say an entire number ago before the last year is old.
[02:19.600 --> 02:22.940]  But would you say that a movie that came out last year is old?
[02:24.440 --> 02:24.840]  Uh...
[02:24.840 --> 02:26.760]  Like, at what point does the year...
[02:26.760 --> 02:30.160]  Like, if something released in that year isn't old, then how is the year old?
[02:30.620 --> 02:32.820]  I was trying to figure out, what is a year old?
[02:32.880 --> 02:34.500]  It depends on what you're talking about.
[02:34.800 --> 02:39.780]  Like, like, Rooster Teeth was, like, 85 years old in internet years.
[02:40.740 --> 02:42.480]  That's true, but that's a different metric.
[02:42.600 --> 02:44.320]  We're talking, like, dog. We're talking internet.
[02:44.900 --> 02:47.000]  And human, normal years.
[02:47.480 --> 02:48.140]  When's a year old?
[02:48.140 --> 02:51.940]  I think when you take the calendar down to replace it with a new calendar,
[02:52.180 --> 02:53.460]  that year becomes old immediately.
[02:54.000 --> 02:55.860]  Yeah, but three, like, three weeks.
[02:56.340 --> 02:57.140]  It's in the past, man.
[02:57.340 --> 02:58.880]  Stop living in the past. What do you care?
[02:59.740 --> 03:00.800]  That was so long ago.
[03:01.560 --> 03:03.580]  See, I think at least it's, like, 10 years at least.
[03:03.600 --> 03:06.860]  Whether it was three weeks ago or three years ago, it's still in the past.
[03:07.340 --> 03:10.020]  10 years? So you think 2016 wasn't a while ago?
[03:10.580 --> 03:11.340]  That's an old year.
[03:11.400 --> 03:11.640]  Oh, fuck.
[03:12.200 --> 03:15.380]  You think 20, you don't think pre-pandemic was a long time ago?
[03:15.520 --> 03:16.780]  That was three lifetimes ago.
[03:17.360 --> 03:20.380]  It is. Yeah, it does feel that way in time.
[03:21.340 --> 03:22.860]  I guess this is where it gets dumb.
[03:23.240 --> 03:26.640]  I feel like it's every 10 years, but it changes per year you're in.
[03:26.920 --> 03:32.620]  So 2009, 2010, that's a that's an old year, 2009.
[03:32.940 --> 03:33.920]  Once you hit a new 10.
[03:34.560 --> 03:38.700]  But if it's 2001, that year doesn't become old until 2010.
[03:39.040 --> 03:41.200]  When does a car become a classic?
[03:41.560 --> 03:42.300]  That's a great question.
[03:42.300 --> 03:43.580]  20 years or 25 years?
[03:43.720 --> 03:45.140]  I think it probably maybe just follows that.
[03:45.140 --> 03:47.600]  Because it's like consoles become retro after 20.
[03:48.140 --> 03:51.520]  When you're when the year ticks over and you can get a special license plate
[03:51.520 --> 03:53.060]  because it's been so long, that's when it's old.
[03:53.500 --> 03:55.480]  Can somebody look up when does a car become a classic?
[03:55.720 --> 04:00.000]  And then there there's no agreed upon age because it varies by state, unfortunately.
[04:00.640 --> 04:01.680]  What about vintage?
[04:02.780 --> 04:04.320]  When does a car become vintage?
[04:05.080 --> 04:05.260]  Yeah.
[04:06.480 --> 04:13.260]  Okay, a car is generally considered vintage if it was manufactured between 1919 and 1930.
[04:14.620 --> 04:15.660]  Okay, well.
[04:15.940 --> 04:17.600]  I would say that's more of an antique car.
[04:18.120 --> 04:18.460]  Yeah.
[04:19.040 --> 04:21.600]  Do you know what really shit me up about years?
[04:22.080 --> 04:22.380]  What?
[04:23.480 --> 04:25.700]  Wizard of Oz, right? Bloody old movie.
[04:26.160 --> 04:26.420]  Yeah.
[04:26.860 --> 04:32.980]  But when I was born, it was a movie as old as if I watched Taxi Driver now.
[04:33.700 --> 04:36.680]  Yeah, that's always the reverse math is always bad.
[04:36.860 --> 04:38.400]  You shouldn't do that math. It's not good.
[04:38.580 --> 04:40.300]  It never makes you feel good.
[04:40.520 --> 04:41.840]  That's sad maths.
[04:41.840 --> 04:46.160]  In the state of Texas, a car, a passenger car, truck or motorcycle
[04:46.160 --> 04:50.220]  becomes a classic after 25 years. You can apply for a classic plate.
[04:50.360 --> 04:52.440]  So what was 25 years ago? 2000?
[04:53.120 --> 04:53.360]  Yeah.
[04:53.620 --> 04:59.100]  Every car every one of us drove with the exception of Gavin in the year 2000 is a classic car.
[04:59.480 --> 05:00.600]  Oh, fuck.
[05:01.080 --> 05:01.480]  Really?
[05:02.060 --> 05:05.780]  How many how many of us would drive driving in 2000?
[05:06.460 --> 05:09.120]  Uh, I was not. I was a freshman in high school.
[05:09.340 --> 05:10.160]  So I was not driving.
[05:10.840 --> 05:12.000]  Every one of us.
[05:12.300 --> 05:14.160]  Hey, Jeff, you're just classic, baby.
[05:14.440 --> 05:18.500]  I was driving to fucking work with Gus in 2000. Jesus.
[05:18.940 --> 05:20.640]  Yeah, that sucks on like a bunch of levels.
[05:22.680 --> 05:24.120]  Anyway, 25 years ago.
[05:24.320 --> 05:24.780]  Not that long.
[05:25.460 --> 05:29.960]  I just looked up wine. Did you know that vintage wine is any wine that has the year printed on it?
[05:30.140 --> 05:31.740]  I thought it had to be really old.
[05:31.880 --> 05:34.880]  Holy shit. Could we print some 2025 vintage wine?
[05:34.980 --> 05:39.760]  Yes, you could. It's literally in the descriptor of wine printed in 2022,
[05:39.760 --> 05:40.980]  would be vintage wine.
[05:41.260 --> 05:42.340]  It's just the year.
[05:42.520 --> 05:47.140]  I think I think we're used. I think wine uses vintage in a different term than you're using
[05:47.140 --> 05:48.620]  vintage. I think wine.
[05:48.820 --> 05:49.480]  That's just the year.
[05:49.820 --> 05:53.860]  Yes, I think the vintage of the wine. It just means the year of the wine.
[05:54.040 --> 05:57.380]  Like, yes, that's just what I'm saying. I didn't know that. That was my point.
[05:58.840 --> 06:01.200]  And I'm not I don't drink wine.
[06:01.300 --> 06:02.860]  So like, I didn't know that.
[06:04.080 --> 06:08.380]  I can't be the only one. When you hear vintage, you think I think in a broader way
[06:08.380 --> 06:11.980]  than the specific use that it seems to be used in wine.
[06:12.380 --> 06:13.420]  What about Neo Vintage?
[06:14.220 --> 06:15.520]  What is Neo Vintage?
[06:16.380 --> 06:18.480]  So what would that be?
[06:19.060 --> 06:20.580]  I don't know. You're the one that pitched it.
[06:20.720 --> 06:23.820]  Like, it's like if if Neo from the Matrix is 25 years old.
[06:24.020 --> 06:26.820]  I was wondering if he marks it.
[06:31.360 --> 06:35.880]  Um, oh, it's a watch thing, Gavin. Neo Vintage is a watch.
[06:35.880 --> 06:39.340]  Oh, yeah, I think I've heard people talking about Neo Vintage watches.
[06:39.740 --> 06:43.980]  When it comes to pre-owned watches, there are different categories that differentiate style.
[06:44.360 --> 06:46.780]  Neo Vintage. There's no clear answer.
[06:47.020 --> 06:53.420]  Great. This has been the worst trying to find this shit has been all like steampunk.
[06:54.020 --> 06:55.040]  Is Neo like steampunk?
[06:56.020 --> 06:56.540]  What?
[06:57.480 --> 07:00.220]  It sounds like it's a style thing, right?
[07:00.280 --> 07:04.320]  Like the use of neon is the same as steampunk, where steampunk represents a style.
[07:05.300 --> 07:05.720]  Uh...
[07:05.720 --> 07:09.220]  Not a thing. That's what I gathered from that statement. Anyway, Gavin, continue.
[07:10.020 --> 07:13.140]  Wait, do you think we're saying Neo or Neon?
[07:13.620 --> 07:15.040]  Neo. And Neo.
[07:15.420 --> 07:16.380]  Okay, I'm just making sure.
[07:16.500 --> 07:20.240]  But then you read it and you're like, you said, oh, it sounds like it's like a style,
[07:20.340 --> 07:22.660]  like there's a style of watches that are called Neo watches.
[07:23.020 --> 07:26.780]  And so I was saying, is it like steampunk or that's also a style?
[07:26.940 --> 07:28.780]  I'm not saying it looks like steampunk,
[07:28.940 --> 07:33.200]  but in the sense that steampunk is a phrase for a specific style.
[07:33.200 --> 07:38.680]  Neo is, uh, just means new. Combining new, recent, revived, or modified.
[07:38.920 --> 07:39.720]  New vintage.
[07:41.040 --> 07:42.160]  Like Neolithic.
[07:43.060 --> 07:44.040]  2025 wine.
[07:44.720 --> 07:47.420]  I don't even... that just sounds like a scam.
[07:47.860 --> 07:54.060]  I want a book that gets me at a surface level into the lingo of a bunch of different niches.
[07:54.580 --> 07:57.880]  You like flip the page to watch and it's like Neo vintage,
[07:58.280 --> 08:01.820]  and then you flip the page to like football and it says like Roll Tide or something.
[08:01.820 --> 08:06.440]  It just gets you by in conversations with just random people you meet at the airport.
[08:07.060 --> 08:12.480]  You know, I played a game when I was in Detroit over Christmas that was kind of like that.
[08:12.600 --> 08:15.320]  It was a game of global catchphrases.
[08:15.800 --> 08:18.220]  And then you'd read a card and then you'd read like three...
[08:22.640 --> 08:24.320]  Everybody had to like write a fake one down.
[08:24.420 --> 08:26.980]  And there was one real one and you had to figure out what the real catchphrase was.
[08:27.080 --> 08:28.160]  But we played for like two hours.
[08:28.220 --> 08:31.280]  I'd never heard or recognized a single phrase from that story.
[08:31.280 --> 08:33.580]  And it was just like places, you know, like this is what they say in Rwanda.
[08:33.820 --> 08:35.500]  And this is what they say in Sweden.
[08:35.500 --> 08:38.120]  And it was fucking I felt like I was learning all kinds of culture.
[08:38.260 --> 08:39.540]  Maybe maybe we get you that game.
[08:39.940 --> 08:46.180]  Is there a certain subculture that has a vernacular you like their usage of or like a word from it?
[08:46.740 --> 08:49.700]  I like in poker the use of sick.
[08:50.000 --> 08:52.320]  I really enjoy because it means everything.
[08:52.600 --> 08:56.480]  It could be either like you have something horrible happen to you.
[08:56.520 --> 08:58.520]  And the response would be that was so sick.
[08:59.240 --> 09:01.920]  Or if it is like you do something amazing.
[09:02.100 --> 09:03.240]  It's like that was that was sick.
[09:03.320 --> 09:03.800]  That was crazy.
[09:03.800 --> 09:04.840]  I didn't realize that was poker.
[09:04.960 --> 09:06.780]  I feel like that's just outside of poker, too.
[09:07.940 --> 09:11.520]  I feel like I hear more so in poker than anywhere else.
[09:12.560 --> 09:17.120]  Yeah, poker would definitely be a chapter in this in this regulation lingo book.
[09:17.860 --> 09:20.780]  Wine and coffee would probably have like at least two pages each.
[09:21.140 --> 09:21.540]  Yeah.
[09:22.040 --> 09:22.760]  Oh, wine.
[09:22.840 --> 09:24.340]  I bet you have some snooty ass.
[09:24.840 --> 09:26.720]  Yeah, there's some snooty feels like.
[09:26.720 --> 09:28.900]  Yeah, snooty itself feels like it's a wine.
[09:30.060 --> 09:31.680]  I don't feel like I use snoot enough.
[09:32.240 --> 09:33.360]  Just in your everyday life?
[09:33.680 --> 09:35.540]  Yeah, like could snoot be a nose?
[09:36.100 --> 09:39.120]  Yeah, you got to you got to get a dog because I say...
[09:39.120 --> 09:39.860]  Am I thinking snout?
[09:40.180 --> 09:42.540]  Yeah, I say it almost every day to my dog.
[09:42.740 --> 09:44.540]  I just go, oh, look at this little snoot.
[09:44.840 --> 09:46.460]  And then I touch his nose.
[09:46.960 --> 09:48.660]  Didn't the Concord have a snoot?
[09:48.700 --> 09:50.540]  Like a little droop snoot on the front?
[09:53.120 --> 09:54.680]  Droop snoot should be gathered.
[09:54.900 --> 09:56.280]  I want to talk about this later, actually.
[09:56.280 --> 09:57.780]  I'm just going to throw this out there.
[09:58.200 --> 10:00.620]  Droop snoot could be Gavin's 2025 nickname.
[10:00.940 --> 10:02.100]  I'll go droop snoot.
[10:02.320 --> 10:03.440]  I think it's this.
[10:03.580 --> 10:04.840]  Hang on, is this real?
[10:05.280 --> 10:06.180]  Yeah, the droop snoot.
[10:06.340 --> 10:07.180]  Why is this?
[10:07.320 --> 10:08.920]  This plane looks bummed out.
[10:09.220 --> 10:10.100]  That's why they don't make it anymore.
[10:10.820 --> 10:13.540]  I think they do that because Gus would know this.
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.720]  I think, well, I think a part of it is so the pilots aren't aimed at the sky the whole way
[10:17.720 --> 10:18.180]  on the runway.
[10:18.880 --> 10:20.920]  So it like snoops, snoots down.
[10:22.840 --> 10:24.120]  Drop the snoot.
[10:24.860 --> 10:25.740]  Raise the snoot.
[10:25.740 --> 10:27.060]  The snoot is jammed.
[10:27.740 --> 10:31.160]  Yeah, because if you're landing a Concorde, which no one is anymore,
[10:32.600 --> 10:36.280]  I don't think you'd be able to see the ground if you didn't droop the snoot.
[10:38.280 --> 10:40.220]  This is this episode.
[10:40.580 --> 10:41.820]  Where's that slider thing?
[10:41.840 --> 10:43.100]  I'm up to like a nine right now.
[10:43.220 --> 10:43.760]  I'm having fun.
[10:44.060 --> 10:48.920]  It looks almost like a plane that isn't circumcised, as I guess is a good way to describe it.
[10:51.260 --> 10:53.620]  Like it looks like there's extra plane.
[10:53.620 --> 10:56.220]  Plane's got extra stuff all over the front of it.
[10:56.360 --> 11:01.000]  It looks like a plane that somebody's older brother broke and then the kid just tried
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.020]  to put it back together as best as he could because he still wanted to run around the yard with it.
[11:05.400 --> 11:07.100]  Dude, that's exactly what it is.
[11:07.300 --> 11:08.220]  Yeah, it's the droop snoot.
[11:08.460 --> 11:08.620]  Yeah.
[11:09.460 --> 11:10.700]  What is Sid's toys?
[11:11.060 --> 11:15.080]  Speaking of Gavin's new nickname, droop snoot, I was thinking of the other day.
[11:15.140 --> 11:16.540]  It's 2025 now, right?
[11:17.040 --> 11:17.560]  Fresh year.
[11:17.920 --> 11:18.220]  New star.
[11:19.060 --> 11:22.620]  We've had a lot of different eras throughout the company.
[11:22.620 --> 11:27.320]  One of which was our nickname era where we went through and everybody was getting new
[11:27.320 --> 11:27.580]  nicknames.
[11:27.820 --> 11:30.040]  And I was thinking, fresh year, fresh start.
[11:30.800 --> 11:35.120]  My initial thought was maybe we pick new nicknames for everybody that we have that
[11:35.120 --> 11:36.580]  are 2025 nicknames.
[11:36.700 --> 11:40.640]  And I was, you know, thinking, I was actually thinking about like, I've been thinking a
[11:40.640 --> 11:41.860]  lot about Panama Jack lately.
[11:41.920 --> 11:46.020]  And I want to, I'll talk about him later at some point because I want to, I want to talk
[11:46.020 --> 11:46.780]  to you guys about it.
[11:48.820 --> 11:52.820]  I want to talk to you guys about a legendary figure I've heard of around these parts called
[11:52.820 --> 11:53.420]  Gerpal Joe.
[11:53.620 --> 11:55.500]  But that's for another, another day.
[11:55.640 --> 12:00.180]  I was thinking it'd be fun if we had nicknames that were associated with locations like Eric
[12:00.180 --> 12:03.060]  because he's the president and because he won the contest.
[12:03.180 --> 12:04.700]  He could be Deputy Eric, right?
[12:04.800 --> 12:09.360]  Because like Deputy Indiana, Panama Jack, San Antonio, like Nick, we could, Nick could
[12:09.360 --> 12:10.900]  be Nick Antonio, right?
[12:11.120 --> 12:13.760]  Nick is so easy to make nicknames for, by the way.
[12:14.500 --> 12:16.000]  But then I had another thought.
[12:16.100 --> 12:22.280]  It evolved from that into what if we did a draft, a nickname draft every year, and then
[12:22.280 --> 12:26.300]  everybody drafts nicknames and the nicknames you get are the nicknames you're allowed to
[12:26.300 --> 12:27.760]  use in that calendar year.
[12:27.960 --> 12:29.760]  So wait, who's drafting a nickname for who?
[12:30.260 --> 12:32.840]  Yeah, we're all drafting our own nicknames from the global pool.
[12:33.040 --> 12:34.560]  And then if you get the nickname you wanted.
[12:34.800 --> 12:37.100]  Now, but you can't pick your own nickname.
[12:37.540 --> 12:42.260]  Like Andrew could, like if Andrew got T-Bone before I do, then he gets to be T-Bone for
[12:42.260 --> 12:42.400]  a year.
[12:42.400 --> 12:46.500]  I like, I like the idea, but they're right.
[12:46.620 --> 12:48.320]  You can't pick your own nickname.
[12:48.500 --> 12:53.560]  So I think what we have to do, since there's five of us and we would all have four slots,
[12:53.660 --> 12:55.820]  we have to draft nicknames for each other.
[12:56.020 --> 12:56.260]  Okay.
[12:56.340 --> 12:58.580]  So we would have to randomize.
[12:58.640 --> 13:03.280]  And then in each slot, I guess the first one would be like Andrew.
[13:03.320 --> 13:05.840]  And then we all give like our Andrew nicknames, except Andrew.
[13:05.980 --> 13:07.560]  And then the next one would be like Gavin.
[13:07.620 --> 13:09.460]  And we all give Gavin nicknames, except Gavin.
[13:09.460 --> 13:12.040]  And so everyone would have four nicknames.
[13:12.360 --> 13:16.740]  Then we spin a wheel and whatever the wheel lands on is what that person's nickname is
[13:16.740 --> 13:17.120]  for the year.
[13:17.740 --> 13:21.820]  I hate it because I don't want to get stuck with another fucking shitty Gooch Pooch situation.
[13:23.540 --> 13:26.000]  This is such a good idea, dude.
[13:26.320 --> 13:29.780]  You could absolutely still get, somebody could submit that for you.
[13:29.940 --> 13:30.920]  I'm putting it.
[13:31.180 --> 13:32.820]  No, we can't use old nicknames.
[13:32.940 --> 13:35.000]  You might end up being Droop Snoop for all we know.
[13:35.480 --> 13:35.980]  Oh no.
[13:36.440 --> 13:37.000]  Droop Snoop?
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.440]  What if, for example, I don't say anyone's going to draft this,
[13:40.520 --> 13:45.880]  but what if all four of the others of us drafted Pissrat for Eric?
[13:46.060 --> 13:48.240]  Would he, would one be taken?
[13:48.520 --> 13:51.960]  Well, then there would be collusion and we would have to, we would have to throw it out.
[13:52.320 --> 13:53.320]  We'd have to throw it out.
[13:53.460 --> 13:54.960]  So you can't have Droop, you can't have Droops.
[13:55.320 --> 13:58.460]  No, I think it would be like when you try to get a gamertag on Xbox Live,
[13:58.540 --> 13:59.900]  someone would just have to put a number on it.
[13:59.980 --> 14:05.980]  I think it'd be Pissrat01, Pissrat69, Pissrat420, X, PissratX.
[14:06.840 --> 14:07.160]  Exactly.
[14:11.020 --> 14:12.120]  That's, that's the title.
[14:13.540 --> 14:14.820]  Oh man, this is fucking great.
[14:14.980 --> 14:15.880]  This is fucking great.
[14:16.240 --> 14:17.200]  I like this nickname thing.
[14:17.400 --> 14:19.760]  All right, so let's do the nickname draft in the way Eric described it.
[14:19.820 --> 14:21.260]  And then, uh, yeah.
[14:21.340 --> 14:22.420]  And then we do the wheel to determine.
[14:22.580 --> 14:24.740]  And then at the end of it, these are our nicknames for the year.
[14:25.360 --> 14:27.140]  And you stuck with them until 2026.
[14:27.240 --> 14:28.540]  I'm putting it in the idea bank.
[14:28.580 --> 14:29.380]  I think we should do this.
[14:29.660 --> 14:29.820]  Okay.
[14:29.960 --> 14:31.860]  Speaking of drafts, we're doing some tomorrow.
[14:32.160 --> 14:34.140]  And speaking of that, I've got Clip.
[14:35.360 --> 14:35.680]  Clip?
[14:36.040 --> 14:36.880]  You want to hear a Clip?
[14:37.320 --> 14:37.940]  I would love to.
[14:38.060 --> 14:38.960]  Are you going to be able to play it?
[14:39.380 --> 14:42.180]  Let me just double check that it's not going to play through some headphones somewhere.
[14:42.420 --> 14:43.080]  Okay, here we go.
[14:43.080 --> 14:44.200]  You just redid your whole computer.
[14:44.460 --> 14:44.780]  I mean...
[14:44.780 --> 14:45.120]  Yeah, yeah.
[14:45.380 --> 14:46.040]  But don't worry.
[14:46.100 --> 14:46.400]  Here we go.
[14:46.460 --> 14:46.600]  Ready?
[14:50.600 --> 14:51.560]  Not hearing it.
[14:53.520 --> 14:54.200]  Not working.
[14:55.860 --> 14:56.780]  Leave all this in.
[14:58.720 --> 15:00.140]  Okay, I'll tell you what happened.
[15:00.880 --> 15:03.160]  It's, uh, it's just a recording of the YouTube video.
[15:03.680 --> 15:04.080]  And it has...
[15:05.720 --> 15:07.800]  And the way that Apple redid their Photos app,
[15:07.800 --> 15:11.520]  I couldn't see the play button because it was, uh, covered up by a bunch of comments.
[15:12.060 --> 15:12.860]  Here we go.
[15:13.020 --> 15:13.440]  These are good.
[15:13.500 --> 15:15.040]  We'll talk about all these Sausage Talk or whatever.
[15:15.160 --> 15:16.400]  We want to pitch these ideas later.
[15:16.400 --> 15:19.900]  But like, Are We Nostradamus was such a fun...
[15:19.900 --> 15:21.320]  I just like that name so much.
[15:21.340 --> 15:21.680]  It's great.
[15:21.900 --> 15:22.740]  We gotta do that soon.
[15:23.600 --> 15:25.320]  I just watched Interview With The Vampire.
[15:25.400 --> 15:26.340]  It's a 94 film.
[15:26.920 --> 15:27.040]  Yeah.
[15:28.080 --> 15:28.460]  I did.
[15:29.300 --> 15:30.200]  That was a few weeks ago.
[15:31.320 --> 15:32.080]  What was the...
[15:32.080 --> 15:33.020]  What was the clip, Gavin?
[15:33.440 --> 15:34.640]  Why are we talking about vampires?
[15:35.280 --> 15:37.040]  Uh, because we were talking about,
[15:37.040 --> 15:43.100]  uh, it came up previously about doing a wheel of years draft
[15:43.100 --> 15:45.900]  where we pick movies that were born or not,
[15:46.080 --> 15:47.640]  that like movies came out the year we were born.
[15:48.040 --> 15:49.480]  And that came out that time.
[15:49.540 --> 15:50.920]  So I remember specifically,
[15:51.140 --> 15:52.880]  I remember that moment that you're playing.
[15:52.980 --> 15:54.740]  It doesn't fit with what was said,
[15:54.800 --> 15:58.980]  but I had been thinking about it because we had mentioned it like a little prior to that.
[15:59.060 --> 16:00.420]  And I was just sitting on that.
[16:00.600 --> 16:04.080]  I just thought that you thought Nostradamus was Nosferatu.
[16:05.240 --> 16:09.160]  No, no, no, man, that would have been awesome.
[16:10.860 --> 16:14.140]  Oh, man, I see what you're doing there.
[16:14.220 --> 16:16.480]  You were laying it out to see if I'd be like,
[16:16.580 --> 16:20.040]  yeah, you know, the guy that knows stuff, Nosferatu, he's a vampire.
[16:20.560 --> 16:21.720]  He was laying the trap at your feet.
[16:21.720 --> 16:22.920]  You were laying the trap.
[16:23.260 --> 16:24.420]  Yeah, I wasn't sure.
[16:24.540 --> 16:25.080]  No, I know the difference.
[16:26.220 --> 16:26.900]  That's fair.
[16:27.360 --> 16:29.180]  That feels like a mistake I could make.
[16:29.380 --> 16:31.000]  But no, I, yeah, that was...
[16:31.000 --> 16:31.380]  They're very similar.
[16:31.660 --> 16:33.180]  It was, the transition was a little funky
[16:33.180 --> 16:36.560]  because I was thinking about it prior to you and it was a reference I had earlier.
[16:36.680 --> 16:39.180]  Wow, that's a rare wriggling out of a clip.
[16:39.460 --> 16:40.320]  That's an invalid clip.
[16:40.600 --> 16:41.180]  I take it back.
[16:43.140 --> 16:45.060]  But I feel like that was worth it.
[16:45.120 --> 16:48.940]  Like, I'm not mad that you tried that because, man, what a moment if I would have not known.
[16:49.240 --> 16:50.820]  Yeah, you can't be afraid.
[16:51.040 --> 16:52.120]  Hey, you can't be afraid.
[16:52.240 --> 16:53.180]  You can't be afraid to take a shot.
[16:53.620 --> 16:53.980]  Absolutely.
[16:55.080 --> 17:00.040]  Recently, we talked a couple episodes ago about our issue with glasses in the ocean
[17:00.040 --> 17:01.820]  and how the ocean is undefeated.
[17:03.180 --> 17:05.760]  A bunch of people in the comments brought up to me
[17:05.760 --> 17:09.180]  the fact that we used to sell the fucking jet ski kit
[17:09.180 --> 17:13.400]  that had the glasses cord on it that we could wrap, that we could put on our glasses
[17:13.400 --> 17:15.960]  so that they would never fucking fall off.
[17:16.100 --> 17:19.700]  And I have like three of them in my fucking house and it never crossed my mind.
[17:19.880 --> 17:21.880]  We used to produce the goddamn things.
[17:24.060 --> 17:25.700]  You created the solution to your own problem.
[17:26.120 --> 17:29.700]  Yeah, we created a problem by ignoring the solution we'd already invented.
[17:31.700 --> 17:33.560]  Invented that we'd already put a logo on.
[17:35.180 --> 17:36.360]  Do you have one?
[17:36.780 --> 17:37.180]  It's really funny.
[17:37.380 --> 17:39.320]  I'm not in front of me, but I have one in my house.
[17:39.380 --> 17:40.300]  I got a couple in my house somewhere.
[17:40.500 --> 17:41.340]  I think I have two.
[17:41.880 --> 17:45.740]  I have them like there's like a bunch of old like stuff somewhere in a box.
[17:46.300 --> 17:47.900]  Is there any Cancun stuff you guys didn't get to?
[17:48.000 --> 17:51.440]  Was there like a moment where like behind the scenes,
[17:51.860 --> 17:55.180]  maybe some texting back and forth of, oh, that was, oh man,
[17:55.440 --> 17:58.660]  that person really did something dumb and we haven't talked about it publicly.
[17:59.220 --> 17:59.980]  Any of those?
[18:00.800 --> 18:04.300]  Eric was eating some sort of a little corn thing.
[18:04.680 --> 18:08.480]  And he described it as if it was like a cake or something.
[18:08.500 --> 18:12.580]  And he described it as if someone made creamed corn solid again.
[18:13.260 --> 18:18.100]  Dude, it was, I got, I got, we were at the buffet and I got a cheesecake.
[18:18.360 --> 18:21.240]  And then the cheesecake was definitely not cheesecake.
[18:21.480 --> 18:22.720]  It was creamed corn.
[18:23.180 --> 18:27.880]  Yeah, it was, it was like a, it was like more of like a cornbread kind of a thing.
[18:27.880 --> 18:30.620]  But it was like if they re-solidify like...
[18:30.620 --> 18:36.000]  Imagine it looks exactly like cheesecake, same consistency and everything,
[18:36.300 --> 18:38.660]  like, like a key, like a key lime pie or a cheesecake,
[18:38.660 --> 18:43.040]  but it just tasted like fucking like savory-ish Swedish sweet corn.
[18:43.320 --> 18:44.560]  It was very strange.
[18:45.440 --> 18:49.280]  Yeah. Another thing that I remember that I don't think we talked about was one night
[18:49.280 --> 18:54.460]  there was entertainment and we watched it and it was like a burlesque show thing.
[18:55.100 --> 18:58.600]  And it was really cool. Like the dancing was really impressive.
[18:58.660 --> 19:01.300]  And there was a woman doing like gymnastic stuff,
[19:01.400 --> 19:03.240]  like contortionist stuff that was like really cool.
[19:04.000 --> 19:09.700]  At one point there was a pole dancer who was doing a pole dance and climbed to the top.
[19:09.840 --> 19:12.260]  It was ultra athletic and it was really impressive.
[19:12.260 --> 19:14.920]  And then she slid down from the top to the bottom.
[19:15.800 --> 19:23.180]  And it, her like legs, what would you say? Skidding down the pole?
[19:23.180 --> 19:28.720]  Think about the most painful time you ever went down a slide at a playground
[19:28.720 --> 19:34.120]  when you were in a dry-ass metal slide. It sounded like that all the way down.
[19:34.640 --> 19:37.980]  Yeah. It was like, it was so impressive what she was doing.
[19:38.300 --> 19:43.860]  And then that happened and it was an audience full of people
[19:43.860 --> 19:47.660]  looking at each other and going, oh, it was pretty cool.
[19:48.060 --> 19:51.520]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[19:51.520 --> 19:54.760]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[19:54.940 --> 19:58.440]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[19:58.800 --> 20:02.580]  Available for a limited time. Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.

[20:24.260 --> 20:26.120]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[20:28.920 --> 20:32.000]  Dude, there was a show, nobody else went but Emily and I, because Emily,
[20:32.620 --> 20:36.600]  half the reason Emily goes to these all-inclusives is for the nightly entertainment.
[20:36.820 --> 20:39.740]  Like, she fucking loves it. We went to every show.
[20:40.460 --> 20:42.480]  I think we missed one, but we went to every other show.
[20:42.780 --> 20:46.000]  We were the only ones to go to the final show, though, which was called Urban,
[20:46.600 --> 20:51.180]  which was just a lot of, like, hip-hop dancing.
[20:51.780 --> 20:54.240]  But there were a couple of segments that were just so off the wall.
[20:54.320 --> 20:58.400]  The only thing that was cohesive about it was that it was kind of like hip-hop themed, right?
[20:58.460 --> 20:58.660]  Urban.
[20:59.000 --> 21:03.880]  But at one point, they had a dance troupe come out, and one of the guys...
[21:03.880 --> 21:04.780]  It took me a while to figure it out.
[21:05.120 --> 21:10.660]  One of the guys was dressed up as Quicksilver from that X-Men movie,
[21:11.120 --> 21:14.240]  where I think it's like Jesse Eisenberg, or where he's got like gray hair,
[21:14.300 --> 21:15.400]  and he wears like a silver outfit.
[21:15.400 --> 21:19.860]  And then the other dudes were bullies that were beating people up in the street,
[21:19.900 --> 21:23.200]  and then he would come and stop time, and then beat them all up,
[21:23.240 --> 21:26.440]  and then start time again, and then beat them all up, and then stop time.
[21:26.680 --> 21:29.260]  And that was a whole routine that went on forever, and it was just suddenly,
[21:29.300 --> 21:30.340]  it was a Marvel thing.
[21:30.560 --> 21:34.040]  And then we had a bunch of other weird, like, there was some jump roping stuff
[21:34.040 --> 21:38.400]  that they did, and a bunch of neon stuff. Neo-neon, I think they called it.
[21:38.400 --> 21:46.380]  And then the final thing was a performance where it was a bunch of dudes that were...
[21:46.380 --> 21:48.780]  I don't know how else to describe it.
[21:49.220 --> 21:51.800]  It was a bunch of guys that were pretending to drive a car,
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.160]  and they were hip-hop dancing while they were driving the car.
[21:54.340 --> 21:57.340]  And then one of them took out the driver, takes out his invisible phone,
[21:57.640 --> 22:01.640]  and they start taking selfies of them dancing and not paying attention to driving.
[22:01.900 --> 22:03.240]  And they're all posing and stuff.
[22:03.460 --> 22:08.140]  And then it's like, and they fake turn the wheel, and then kaboom!
[22:08.140 --> 22:12.980]  The fake car explodes because they were texting and taking photos instead of driving.
[22:13.280 --> 22:15.120]  And then all the guys fall down on the ground.
[22:15.560 --> 22:21.220]  And then the V for Vendetta guy shows up, but he's dressed all in white like an angel.
[22:21.440 --> 22:23.880]  But he's got, like, the fucking Guy Fawkes mask on and everything.
[22:24.300 --> 22:25.920]  And he dances around them for a while.
[22:26.080 --> 22:30.160]  And then he pulls out four V for Vendetta masks, and he puts them on their chests.
[22:30.480 --> 22:32.820]  And then they come back to life, and they all dance together.
[22:32.960 --> 22:33.920]  And then that was it. It was over.
[22:34.120 --> 22:34.740]  Hell yeah!
[22:34.740 --> 22:38.300]  It was the most bizarre storytelling I think I've ever seen.
[22:38.300 --> 22:38.420]  That's great.
[22:38.860 --> 22:40.360]  I dropped a couple videos in here.
[22:40.460 --> 22:44.180]  They are not necessarily of what Jeff is describing, but it is the same show
[22:44.800 --> 22:48.600]  where people are just dribbling basketballs to a middling crowd.
[22:49.160 --> 22:50.360]  Oh yeah, a lot of basketball dribbling.
[22:50.640 --> 22:52.480]  It's just people watching it.
[22:52.640 --> 22:59.120]  That second video is just an astronaut, I think, dribbling, holding a basketball.
[22:59.540 --> 23:01.640]  And then the LA Lakers join him.
[23:01.980 --> 23:03.480]  And it's pretty special.
[23:03.720 --> 23:04.360]  It's pretty cool.
[23:04.360 --> 23:08.900]  What if we sold a photorealistic Guy Fawkes mask?
[23:10.980 --> 23:14.220]  I think that's the best idea I have ever heard.
[23:14.620 --> 23:20.120]  We just take it, and it looks kind of like the symbolic part of people like, what's...
[23:21.880 --> 23:23.480]  Well, Guy Fawkes was a guy.
[23:25.660 --> 23:26.300]  Go ahead.
[23:27.400 --> 23:29.960]  I know Guy Fawkes from V for Vendetta.
[23:30.080 --> 23:32.340]  That's my touchpoint of Guy Fawkes.
[23:32.800 --> 23:35.340]  You don't know him from Parliament?
[23:36.600 --> 23:39.160]  No, I don't know anything about Guy Fawkes.
[23:39.700 --> 23:42.140]  I thought he has a dumb hat on, that photo you posted.
[23:43.800 --> 23:47.040]  I think he tried to blow up Parliament and his name was Guido.
[23:47.920 --> 23:50.460]  Oh, isn't that kind of the plot for V for Vendetta?
[23:52.080 --> 23:56.060]  Wait, is V for Vendetta just the Guy Fawkes story told in a...
[23:56.440 --> 23:57.580]  I've never seen V for Vendetta.
[23:57.900 --> 23:58.320]  I just know...
[23:59.040 --> 24:00.460]  Has Hugo Weaving in it?
[24:00.460 --> 24:02.820]  And I think it's Matrix-y, maybe?
[24:03.160 --> 24:03.800]  Natalie Portman?
[24:04.280 --> 24:04.760]  Is she in it?
[24:04.800 --> 24:05.120]  Is it the Matrix?
[24:05.820 --> 24:09.580]  I feel like for some reason, maybe it's just because Hugo Weaving is in it,
[24:09.620 --> 24:10.920]  and I was a kid when I saw it.
[24:11.160 --> 24:13.320]  I associate it with the Matrix for some reason.
[24:13.700 --> 24:16.580]  Does Guy Fawkes get hung, drawn, and caught at the end?
[24:17.020 --> 24:21.100]  I don't remember anything about it outside of he has these knives he throws,
[24:21.320 --> 24:26.380]  and there's something about remembering the 5th of November or December or...
[24:26.380 --> 24:29.200]  That's when he's got to get his knives sharpened.
[24:29.960 --> 24:31.320]  They get dull.
[24:31.960 --> 24:35.640]  Remember the 5th of November or December or...
[24:35.640 --> 24:36.400]  It's one of the birds.
[24:38.120 --> 24:40.360]  Yeah, in England, we have Guy Fawkes Night on the 5th of November,
[24:40.540 --> 24:41.780]  and that's when we do our fireworks.
[24:42.380 --> 24:46.420]  And we have a bonfire, and we sometimes chuck a Guy Fawkes dummy onto it.
[24:46.800 --> 24:48.360]  Was Guy Fawkes a knife guy?
[24:50.660 --> 24:55.440]  Because he was in the comic, and then I feel like he's throwing a lot of knives around.
[24:55.720 --> 24:57.880]  How do you spell Guy Fawkes, Andrew?
[24:58.420 --> 25:01.560]  G-U-Y-F-A-W-K-E-S.
[25:02.500 --> 25:02.840]  Guy Fawkes.
[25:02.840 --> 25:05.040]  One day you should learn about the Gunpowder Plot.
[25:05.720 --> 25:06.800]  The Gunpowder Plot?
[25:07.100 --> 25:07.320]  Yeah.
[25:07.440 --> 25:08.540]  Do you remember Lord of the Rings?
[25:08.700 --> 25:09.440]  Or not Lord of the Rings.
[25:09.520 --> 25:15.180]  Do you remember King's Landing when they had all the dragons fire under all of King's Landing?
[25:15.300 --> 25:15.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[25:17.920 --> 25:19.460]  What does that have to do with anything?
[25:19.580 --> 25:20.920]  Here, this should be able to catch you.
[25:21.060 --> 25:21.820]  So if you want to...
[25:21.820 --> 25:23.700]  Eric just posted a photo of Gunpowder Plot.
[25:23.700 --> 25:31.180]  Or a brief account of the bloody and futile defiance laid against the king,
[25:31.380 --> 25:35.160]  his lords and commons in Parliament, and a happy deliverance by divine power.
[25:35.780 --> 25:38.140]  Okay, so Guy praying at a window.
[25:38.760 --> 25:39.980]  Wefter minister.
[25:41.500 --> 25:42.380]  I don't know.
[25:42.540 --> 25:43.460]  Wefter minister.
[25:44.720 --> 25:45.680]  Then a woman praying.
[25:47.120 --> 25:51.460]  And I can't read the bottom part of the text because it is small on my screen.
[25:52.680 --> 25:54.060]  So it's just a bunch of prayers.
[25:54.180 --> 25:56.900]  I don't know what I was supposed to learn from that.
[25:58.140 --> 25:59.020]  They're praying?
[25:59.840 --> 26:01.660]  Yeah, they're praying for gunpowder.
[26:02.080 --> 26:03.460]  Why do they need gunpowder?
[26:03.920 --> 26:04.740]  For the plot.
[26:06.860 --> 26:08.160]  To enact the plot.
[26:08.320 --> 26:11.300]  Was the Matrix part of the Guy Fawkes movie?
[26:11.420 --> 26:12.700]  Can someone look that up?
[26:12.780 --> 26:14.440]  Was V for Vendetta tied to the Matrix?
[26:14.520 --> 26:16.440]  Nobody has to look it up.
[26:16.820 --> 26:18.140]  No, yeah, nobody's gonna look it up.
[26:18.140 --> 26:21.440]  No, I think the Matrix people, the Wachowskis, I think,
[26:21.440 --> 26:22.120]  were involved.
[26:22.260 --> 26:22.720]  Were they not?
[26:23.420 --> 26:24.820]  Was it not produced by the people?
[26:25.120 --> 26:27.300]  Do you think that makes it tied into the Matrix?
[26:27.980 --> 26:32.300]  Well, I feel like in the trailer, you know, like when you saw the Greatest Showman trailer,
[26:32.400 --> 26:34.940]  they're like from the lyricist of La La Land.
[26:35.400 --> 26:39.980]  It's like it's not related, but like they're promoting the other works of the people connected.
[26:40.260 --> 26:42.920]  In the sense that Hugo Weaving is a big part of both, it's related.
[26:43.400 --> 26:44.720]  I wonder if it's just that.
[26:44.760 --> 26:45.480]  I need to know.
[26:46.260 --> 26:47.200]  I guess I'll Google it.
[26:47.220 --> 26:47.940]  I'll search it up.
[26:48.060 --> 26:49.100]  V for Vendetta.
[26:49.100 --> 26:51.600]  Is Lord of the Rings part of the Matrix universe?
[26:52.380 --> 26:54.340]  No, Peter Jackson has no involvement.
[26:55.020 --> 26:56.480]  But Hugo Weaving was in both.
[26:57.360 --> 26:59.080]  You what? Oh yeah, he's the elf guy.
[26:59.560 --> 26:59.960]  He's Elrond.
[27:00.400 --> 27:01.360]  Elrond the elf guy.
[27:01.840 --> 27:07.480]  I was thinking about this recently where I like when characters are way more famous
[27:07.480 --> 27:09.180]  than the actor playing them.
[27:09.700 --> 27:14.560]  Like this guy, he could say, he could genuinely say to people,
[27:14.560 --> 27:17.280]  Oh yeah, I was in Lord of the Rings.
[27:18.020 --> 27:19.100]  And you'd be like, huh?
[27:19.840 --> 27:20.840]  Who do you play?
[27:21.280 --> 27:23.320]  And then he could just say, the ring.
[27:24.440 --> 27:24.840]  What?
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.740]  And you'd be like, wow, that's cool.
[27:28.120 --> 27:29.800]  You're the ring from Lord of the Rings.
[27:30.260 --> 27:31.840]  But an unassuming face.
[27:33.280 --> 27:34.660]  Yeah, he doesn't look like a ring at all.
[27:35.200 --> 27:37.080]  I mean, he's in a circle, but that's different.
[27:37.600 --> 27:39.560]  Does he sound like the ring sounds normally?
[27:39.800 --> 27:40.680]  Is he like whispering?
[27:40.960 --> 27:41.480]  I don't know, he's dead.
[27:41.940 --> 27:43.400]  He's got three voices layered over.
[27:43.400 --> 27:44.620]  Oh, he probably doesn't.
[27:44.700 --> 27:45.100]  He's a ghost.
[27:45.300 --> 27:49.060]  My mom thought that we were getting our house invaded when I was a kid
[27:49.060 --> 27:51.760]  because I got really into Lord of the Rings action figures.
[27:52.320 --> 27:53.440]  That was like the thing I collected.
[27:53.980 --> 27:56.800]  And I had this Sauron one that had a voice box in it.
[27:56.940 --> 27:58.740]  And I played with them in the tub.
[27:59.140 --> 28:00.520]  All my Lord of the Rings figures.
[28:01.160 --> 28:06.040]  And it made the Sauron go off one day, like she was cleaning in a room.
[28:06.340 --> 28:12.180]  And she could just hear this faint, like the darkness is coming type thing.
[28:12.180 --> 28:13.480]  And she's like, what, what?
[28:13.740 --> 28:18.060]  And then just like a few minutes later is like, oh, the death comes closer.
[28:18.440 --> 28:20.220]  And it freaked her out.
[28:20.800 --> 28:24.300]  And that was the end of my Lord of the Rings toys in that room.
[28:24.620 --> 28:26.400]  They relocated, binned.
[28:27.300 --> 28:28.900]  Maybe Sauron got thrown away.
[28:29.000 --> 28:29.760]  I don't I don't remember.
[28:29.820 --> 28:33.400]  I just remember it was a big deal that Sauron started talking by himself
[28:33.400 --> 28:36.280]  because I got him wet and said menacing things.
[28:37.260 --> 28:39.460]  Well, he's got an eye made of fire.
[28:40.020 --> 28:43.060]  V for Vendetta, the film written by the Wachowskis.
[28:43.160 --> 28:44.160]  I am not insane.
[28:44.480 --> 28:45.720]  Wow, Wachowskis related.
[28:46.760 --> 28:47.640]  Thank you.
[28:47.680 --> 28:49.580]  Does that have anything to do with the Matrix?
[28:50.260 --> 28:51.500]  They made the Matrix.
[28:52.480 --> 28:56.160]  I bet you if we were to watch a trailer for V for Vendetta right now,
[28:56.220 --> 28:59.560]  I bet you it says from the people that brought you the Matrix.
[29:00.240 --> 29:03.200]  David Lynch made a racer head in Dune.
[29:03.400 --> 29:05.320]  Do you think those things had anything to do with each other?
[29:06.060 --> 29:08.300]  If they promoted them that way, maybe.
[29:09.080 --> 29:10.440]  Didn't he do Elephant Man as well?
[29:10.940 --> 29:11.620]  Yeah, of course he did.
[29:11.760 --> 29:13.540]  But nominated for like eight Academy Awards for Elephant Man.
[29:13.980 --> 29:17.220]  How did they get the massive Sauron eye up on that thing?
[29:17.860 --> 29:18.180]  Hoist?
[29:19.620 --> 29:21.380]  Like, where was the foreman?
[29:21.460 --> 29:22.540]  Was the tower already there?
[29:22.680 --> 29:24.120]  And there was some guy still on the roof going like,
[29:24.200 --> 29:25.280]  all right, this is where I'll put the eye.
[29:25.600 --> 29:26.140]  But how did it?
[29:26.840 --> 29:28.160]  Does it explain that in the book?
[29:28.840 --> 29:29.640]  Have you ever read the book?
[29:29.640 --> 29:32.320]  You gotta read the Simmerillion or whatever it's called.
[29:33.300 --> 29:34.700]  It's not a physical eye.
[29:35.340 --> 29:35.800]  What do you mean?
[29:36.460 --> 29:37.140]  It's not an eye?
[29:37.140 --> 29:38.980]  I felt like it was a projection.
[29:39.620 --> 29:40.160]  Like it was...
[29:40.160 --> 29:41.100]  Like a hologram of an eye?
[29:41.160 --> 29:42.200]  I think so, yeah.
[29:42.340 --> 29:45.100]  So where do they put the 4K projector?
[29:46.460 --> 29:47.380]  It's gotta be close.
[29:48.020 --> 29:50.340]  Was it like Disney where they just hide projectors all over the...
[29:50.340 --> 29:52.860]  I think it's more likely than it was a giant eye.
[29:53.180 --> 29:54.120]  I thought it was a giant eye.
[29:54.180 --> 29:55.060]  They knocked the building down.
[29:55.140 --> 29:55.740]  They killed the eye.
[29:56.380 --> 29:56.900]  Maybe you're right.
[29:57.020 --> 29:58.640]  I'm not an expert on Lord of the Rings.
[29:58.920 --> 30:02.020]  They put it up a tower, I think, so it could see.
[30:02.140 --> 30:04.060]  I think if it was just a hologram of an eye,
[30:04.160 --> 30:05.160]  why didn't they just put it in a room?
[30:05.620 --> 30:06.760]  Why didn't they just project it on a couch?
[30:07.820 --> 30:09.140]  Because they wanted it to see?
[30:09.820 --> 30:11.580]  How can a projection see?
[30:12.300 --> 30:12.860]  I don't know.
[30:13.380 --> 30:14.560]  There's fucking orcs.
[30:14.840 --> 30:15.400]  There's elves.
[30:16.300 --> 30:19.820]  There's bread that you take a little bite of and it fills you up for a whole meal.
[30:19.960 --> 30:20.100]  I don't know.
[30:20.140 --> 30:25.680]  You're going to use Lampus bread and orcs and elks to...
[30:25.680 --> 30:27.940]  I'm going to say that it's a fantasy world.
[30:28.360 --> 30:30.320]  In a fantasy world, I think it's just as plausible
[30:30.320 --> 30:33.180]  it was a real giant eye up there as anything else.
[30:33.360 --> 30:35.540]  Yeah, I thought you just didn't have like a physical form.
[30:35.960 --> 30:37.600]  I mean, even when he's fighting at the beginning,
[30:37.780 --> 30:40.740]  he's not, you can't see Sauron, you just see his armor.
[30:41.240 --> 30:41.520]  That's true.
[30:41.680 --> 30:42.480]  I just assumed it.
[30:42.580 --> 30:44.040]  Well, there's a guy in a suit, right?
[30:44.820 --> 30:47.540]  I don't think there's a natural physical body.
[30:47.800 --> 30:49.040]  Sauron isn't, was never physical.
[30:49.040 --> 30:50.420]  I thought he was in the suit.
[30:50.980 --> 30:51.560]  Oh, yeah, I think he was.
[30:52.120 --> 30:54.860]  Maybe that's what he wants you to think, Andrew.
[30:55.360 --> 30:58.060]  There are people that have all these answers that are really into this
[30:58.060 --> 31:00.240]  that are pulling their hair out listening to us talking about this.
[31:00.300 --> 31:03.200]  I mean, to be fair, he was wearing a ring that makes other people invisible.
[31:03.360 --> 31:04.400]  Maybe it just made him invisible.
[31:06.560 --> 31:07.800]  Hmm, that's a good point.
[31:08.400 --> 31:11.420]  Nick's pretending that he doesn't know the answers to this stuff.
[31:11.520 --> 31:12.760]  Yeah, fill us in, Nick.
[31:13.740 --> 31:14.340]  No, I don't know.
[31:15.140 --> 31:16.200]  I couldn't tell you.
[31:16.320 --> 31:19.340]  I think Sauron used to be a physical person
[31:19.340 --> 31:23.900]  and then became some manifestation of evil and then became an eye.
[31:23.900 --> 31:26.100]  You can watch the Rings of Power on Amazon.
[31:26.320 --> 31:29.820]  They go into the prequel, the before of all this a little bit.
[31:29.860 --> 31:31.480]  I think it's that sleight of shit though, isn't it?
[31:31.480 --> 31:32.520]  Isn't it a bunch of made up shit?
[31:32.940 --> 31:35.100]  I watched the first couple episodes and they're pretty good.
[31:35.500 --> 31:36.360]  Yeah, but it's made up.
[31:36.420 --> 31:38.580]  I think it was mostly about Saruman though, not Sauron.
[31:39.120 --> 31:43.120]  My favorite episode of the Rings of Power show is when they're trying to bring the eye up
[31:43.120 --> 31:46.040]  and the hallway's too narrow and they just couldn't get it to fit.
[31:46.700 --> 31:49.280]  It's like six orcs holding it, trying to get it around the corner.
[31:49.280 --> 31:52.060]  Yeah, they're trying to get it up the staircase because it's the new eye and they're just...
[31:53.240 --> 31:56.860]  They gotta hire that guy who comes and saws it in half to fit it up the stairs
[31:56.860 --> 31:58.520]  when he reassembles it when it's at the top.
[31:59.060 --> 31:59.400]  Yeah.
[32:00.160 --> 32:01.320]  Like sofas in New York City.
[32:01.820 --> 32:04.880]  I do really like prequel stories where they show the...
[32:05.380 --> 32:09.800]  In Better Call Saul, there's a whole bit where they're digging the lab
[32:09.800 --> 32:13.220]  and it's cool to see the origin story of a room.
[32:13.720 --> 32:16.000]  And I would love that for Lord of the Rings, just for that tower.
[32:16.720 --> 32:18.260]  I hope we can give that to you someday, Gavin.
[32:19.080 --> 32:20.140]  I don't think we can.
[32:20.880 --> 32:22.920]  Who owns... is that Warner or Amazon?
[32:23.000 --> 32:24.800]  Who owns Lord of the Rings at this point?
[32:25.760 --> 32:26.360]  Is it Amazon?
[32:26.680 --> 32:27.000]  Amazon, I think.
[32:27.520 --> 32:27.840]  Okay.
[32:28.280 --> 32:31.380]  I think that there is some dispute over who owns what.
[32:31.600 --> 32:34.060]  I think some people own some and other people own others.
[32:34.620 --> 32:35.820]  Yeah, I think so.
[32:36.320 --> 32:39.400]  Hey guys, can I ask you guys an unrelated to Lord of the Rings question?
[32:39.860 --> 32:40.120]  Of course.
[32:40.960 --> 32:43.040]  I was watching sports last night, right?
[32:43.100 --> 32:43.560]  As I do.
[32:43.660 --> 32:47.240]  I was watching my Celtics play the Clippers in Los Angeles.
[32:47.460 --> 32:48.360]  And of course we won.
[32:48.420 --> 32:49.160]  Almost blew it.
[32:49.240 --> 32:49.880]  Had to go to overtime.
[32:50.000 --> 32:52.760]  No fucking reason other than just sloppy play.
[32:52.900 --> 32:54.000]  Thank Christ we won.
[32:54.600 --> 32:59.100]  However, I'm watching the game and after about five minutes,
[32:59.700 --> 33:03.920]  there's a guy on the Clippers who's playing out of his mind.
[33:04.160 --> 33:05.800]  His name is Derek Jones Jr.
[33:06.380 --> 33:13.280]  And I'm tangentially aware of Derek Jones Jr. as a role filler on teams around the NBA for a while.
[33:13.500 --> 33:14.460]  He's not a superstar.
[33:14.600 --> 33:16.600]  He's not an all-star in no danger of becoming any of those things.
[33:16.720 --> 33:18.020]  Probably a bench player most of the time.
[33:19.560 --> 33:23.760]  And he's playing because on the bench is Kawhi Leonard and James Harden.
[33:23.920 --> 33:26.280]  And they're sitting on the bench in their street clothes.
[33:27.460 --> 33:29.120]  And just watching the game.
[33:29.560 --> 33:33.560]  You know, just fucking courtside in their street clothes because they're not playing.
[33:33.800 --> 33:37.580]  And I got to thinking about how much money those two seats were taking up.
[33:37.620 --> 33:38.560]  And so I looked it up.
[33:39.200 --> 33:45.580]  James Harden and Kawhi Leonard, I think combined to make about $94 million this year for the Clippers.
[33:46.220 --> 33:47.860]  And I looked up that guy Derek Jones Jr.
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.120]  who scored 17 points in the first quarter, which is huge.
[33:52.180 --> 33:53.680]  He only went on to score 20 in the game.
[33:54.220 --> 33:56.620]  But he scored 17 points in the first quarter.
[33:57.560 --> 33:59.440]  He makes about $3 million a year.
[34:00.280 --> 34:05.460]  My question to you guys is, oh, also, not only were Kawhi and James Harden in street clothes
[34:05.460 --> 34:07.720]  on the bench, they were sitting next to the coach.
[34:08.080 --> 34:09.620]  They took the good seats on the bench.
[34:09.720 --> 34:13.800]  The players who were playing the game were further down the bench, further away.
[34:14.440 --> 34:19.940]  Like, and I got me just thinking, does a guy like Derek Jones fucking hate Kawhi Leonard
[34:19.940 --> 34:25.000]  and James Harden for, like, getting to basically show up at work in street clothes and eat
[34:25.000 --> 34:32.120]  popcorn and watch him bust his ass while they make a hundred times a year more than he makes?
[34:32.400 --> 34:35.260]  I feel like you're describing every business ever.
[34:35.560 --> 34:38.860]  From, like, the CEO to, like, the people working down.
[34:38.920 --> 34:39.880]  Well, I mean, that's not even...
[34:39.880 --> 34:42.780]  I mean, if we're going to talk about every business there, then the owner is fucking
[34:42.780 --> 34:45.720]  laughing at James Harden and Kawhi Leonard right now because he's making hundreds of
[34:45.720 --> 34:46.740]  millions of dollars an hour.
[34:46.740 --> 34:51.080]  But it's just, like, it's so crazy to see the disparity where they do the same job.
[34:51.280 --> 34:55.400]  They're on the same court at the same time, in theory.
[34:55.800 --> 35:00.460]  But the... not only is the disparity... because I understand that the talent dictates where
[35:00.460 --> 35:04.400]  money goes, but it's just crazy to me that you can be... you can make that much more
[35:04.400 --> 35:06.300]  with... and have zero availability.
[35:06.660 --> 35:08.340]  Like, you're just like, I'm Kawhi Leonard.
[35:08.460 --> 35:13.880]  I played 20 games in the last three years, but I'm still going to go to every game in
[35:13.880 --> 35:17.920]  my street clothes, get my free sodas, and make, like, $50 million a year for being,
[35:18.060 --> 35:19.880]  like, a vibes dude, I guess, at this point.
[35:20.000 --> 35:21.680]  It's just... I know it exists...
[35:21.680 --> 35:22.460]  So it's just like a legacy?
[35:24.520 --> 35:28.560]  He doesn't really have a legacy in that arena or with that team because he's been
[35:28.560 --> 35:29.780]  hurt since he got signed to them.
[35:30.040 --> 35:33.780]  He has a legacy from two previous teams, but that didn't... that legacy doesn't travel
[35:33.780 --> 35:35.500]  to the new team where he's done nothing for them.
[35:35.760 --> 35:38.660]  I just, like... it's just crazy to see it on display.
[35:38.760 --> 35:42.240]  And it makes me wonder, is, like, Derek Jones happy that they're proud of him because he's
[35:42.240 --> 35:43.900]  balling out and they're, like, rooting him on?
[35:44.100 --> 35:47.720]  Or is he like, then fuck you, man, I'm out here sweating my fucking ass off and you're
[35:47.720 --> 35:52.120]  making more money watching me play than I'm making playing right now because you can't
[35:52.120 --> 35:53.720]  be bothered to put the fucking uniform on.
[35:54.080 --> 35:55.400]  Is that why they're not playing?
[35:58.320 --> 36:00.280]  I mean... yeah, right?
[36:01.100 --> 36:01.960]  Is that right?
[36:02.660 --> 36:05.880]  Kawhi Leonard should retire if he can't play basketball.
[36:06.220 --> 36:07.720]  Kawhi Leonard should retire.
[36:07.880 --> 36:08.520]  I agree.
[36:08.880 --> 36:12.140]  I don't know that they're out there doing the same job.
[36:12.240 --> 36:13.740]  I also think...
[36:13.740 --> 36:17.220]  No, one of them is doing a job and the other one isn't doing a job at all.
[36:17.940 --> 36:22.820]  I think Derek Jones Jr. is probably stoked to be on a team with Kawhi Leonard and James
[36:22.820 --> 36:23.020]  Harden.
[36:23.080 --> 36:23.380]  Why?
[36:23.480 --> 36:25.520]  He's never gonna play with Kawhi Leonard.
[36:26.160 --> 36:27.660]  Two guys who are gonna sit.
[36:28.040 --> 36:29.300]  And so he gets minutes.
[36:29.740 --> 36:32.360]  Because he's not cutting it somewhere else.
[36:33.660 --> 36:34.120]  I guess.
[36:34.420 --> 36:36.960]  If he's gonna play somewhere, it's here or the G League.
[36:37.240 --> 36:39.820]  By the way, James Harden was out with groin soreness.
[36:40.740 --> 36:41.540]  I hear light.
[36:42.000 --> 36:45.180]  Like, is he like cranking off too hard or like what happened?
[36:45.580 --> 36:48.620]  Yeah, like he pulled a muscle banging somebody and so he can't play.
[36:49.080 --> 36:49.580]  Yeah, he pulled that muscle real hard.
[36:49.600 --> 36:52.480]  We're gonna need to have somebody sub in for me next week on the podcast.
[36:52.680 --> 36:54.340]  I understand people getting hurt.
[36:55.060 --> 36:56.720]  I understand injuries are a thing.
[36:57.020 --> 36:57.940]  It's just crazy.
[36:58.540 --> 37:01.000]  I just I just wonder if I'm Derek Jones Jr. in that moment.
[37:01.080 --> 37:02.220]  I'm just like, man, fuck these guys.
[37:02.240 --> 37:02.940]  Don't root for me.
[37:03.280 --> 37:07.720]  Think about though, in the context of like coaches or like even hockey, they have buyouts.
[37:07.720 --> 37:12.060]  The premise of like, you're so not wanted that we will pay you to leave,
[37:12.160 --> 37:14.480]  like we'll just pay out the rest of your contract to go.
[37:15.080 --> 37:17.220]  Yeah, that's a great way to make money in the NBA.
[37:17.680 --> 37:18.800]  And now here's two things.
[37:18.860 --> 37:21.680]  And here's why I get the point that you're making.
[37:23.320 --> 37:27.660]  There's a reason when you go to awards for Kawhi Leonard,
[37:28.300 --> 37:33.080]  and you see a fourth and rookie of the year, defensive player of the year twice,
[37:33.080 --> 37:34.080]  all star.
[37:34.380 --> 37:40.380]  And then you look at Derek Jones Jr. and his award sections real blank all the way down.
[37:40.620 --> 37:41.660]  I think that's why.
[37:42.260 --> 37:46.180]  When was the last time Kawhi Leonard won one of those awards?
[37:47.120 --> 37:49.360]  Once you pop up the last year that was.
[37:49.560 --> 37:51.020]  It's like two seasons ago.
[37:51.320 --> 37:54.640]  So what I'm saying is that I think Derek Jones Jr. is just fine
[37:54.640 --> 37:57.760]  being the role player that he is on that team.
[37:58.160 --> 37:59.520]  I think he's totally fine with it.
[37:59.520 --> 38:05.400]  I think he's so fine with making $3 million to go out there and put up something.
[38:05.400 --> 38:05.820]  Yeah, I guess.
[38:05.980 --> 38:09.700]  And unless you're in a situation like the Clippers are going to be in,
[38:09.820 --> 38:13.060]  where they're going to have to move parts to try to compete in some way,
[38:13.100 --> 38:14.940]  and they're not going to move Kawhi or James Harden.
[38:15.160 --> 38:18.120]  So everybody on that team who's busting their ass right now becomes trade fodder.
[38:18.300 --> 38:20.680]  It's what the Lakers have done the last five years in a row.
[38:20.700 --> 38:24.040]  And they can't build any kind of cohesion or team loyalty because
[38:24.040 --> 38:26.180]  everybody is expendable but two people.
[38:26.380 --> 38:28.560]  And those two people want to win today.
[38:28.560 --> 38:31.620]  And so they don't, they just don't give a fuck about the other people around them.
[38:31.740 --> 38:34.000]  I just, I don't, it's just, it's just weird to me.
[38:34.520 --> 38:36.640]  It's just weird to me that I haven't seen Kawhi Leonard play,
[38:36.700 --> 38:40.660]  suit up and play basketball more than three games in the last however many years.
[38:40.660 --> 38:44.420]  But he's still, he's taken up a $50 million spot on a bench.
[38:44.780 --> 38:45.420]  It's just wild.
[38:45.780 --> 38:48.700]  It is like a weird thing to think about like money, not,
[38:49.260 --> 38:51.760]  money spent not being used in the way it's intended.
[38:52.060 --> 38:54.080]  But I also feel like that's sports.
[38:54.560 --> 38:58.540]  Like, I feel like the ideal trajectory of an athlete is having...
[38:58.540 --> 39:01.020]  Sports now, it didn't used to be that way.
[39:01.560 --> 39:01.680]  Sure.
[39:01.760 --> 39:04.860]  Yeah, that, that's, I had this conversation with friends the other day where they were like,
[39:04.980 --> 39:09.300]  why are their TV shows like ballers and Arliss in like the 2000s?
[39:09.300 --> 39:14.020]  And it's like, oh, because money came into sports in the 80s, in the 90s.
[39:14.020 --> 39:15.800]  I just feel like we just, we just throw our arms up and say,
[39:15.900 --> 39:17.580]  oh, that's just the way things are now.
[39:17.620 --> 39:21.480]  But they're, that doesn't, I, I mean, I'm not going to change anything.
[39:21.520 --> 39:22.480]  I don't know what I would change.
[39:22.620 --> 39:27.360]  I just, it's just wild to me to, to see it and to think about it from those terms.
[39:27.360 --> 39:32.200]  Like these dudes are not that different in terms of ability.
[39:32.400 --> 39:32.500]  Sure.
[39:32.560 --> 39:35.460]  Like when you're at, when you're at the point where you're an NBA player,
[39:35.480 --> 39:39.960]  the difference between the best NBA player on the court and the worst NBA player is
[39:40.900 --> 39:42.340]  fractional. It really is.
[39:42.420 --> 39:46.100]  Like once you're like one of the top four or 500 people in the world at doing this thing,
[39:46.120 --> 39:51.660]  it's like, I think, I think the, the, the scale is the, the notches on the scale are so minute.
[39:52.040 --> 39:54.340]  And it's just crazy to think that those dudes both
[39:54.340 --> 39:57.420]  are almost exactly as good at basketball as each other,
[39:57.480 --> 40:00.640]  but one of them is playing and making a hundredth of what the other guy is.
[40:01.160 --> 40:03.340]  Do you think when we do the drafts for sports improvements,
[40:03.480 --> 40:05.820]  you can bring something to the table that would fix that problem?
[40:06.220 --> 40:09.380]  I think I, I didn't think of the sports drafts in that way,
[40:09.460 --> 40:10.640]  but I'm going to go back and reevaluate.
[40:11.700 --> 40:16.380]  I've been in the lab. Had a little bit of lab time today. You want to see?
[40:16.800 --> 40:16.880]  Yeah.
[40:18.420 --> 40:20.120]  An unassuming folder.
[40:20.960 --> 40:23.420]  Files for jobs number one and two.
[40:23.420 --> 40:24.940]  What is this?
[40:26.820 --> 40:28.040]  Do you know what that is?
[40:28.420 --> 40:30.420]  No, it's a bug roll folder.
[40:30.660 --> 40:32.540]  It's a freaking bug roll folder.
[40:32.980 --> 40:37.560]  I thought it was for, I thought it was files for this and for slow-mo guys.
[40:43.400 --> 40:43.920]  Wow.
[40:44.680 --> 40:46.720]  I crammed a whole bug roll in there.
[40:47.900 --> 40:49.040]  Oh, do you have any other photos?
[40:49.240 --> 40:49.860]  Oh, wow.
[40:50.380 --> 40:51.740]  That's pretty, that's a lot of bug.
[40:52.520 --> 40:58.020]  Now, how many sheets is it? How big is each individual portion?
[40:58.720 --> 41:01.860]  I don't know. I just kind of bug rolled it and split it into quarters.
[41:02.360 --> 41:04.560]  And unfortunately, it's intended purpose,
[41:04.660 --> 41:09.120]  an entire bug roll will not fit under the door to my bug.
[41:09.500 --> 41:12.840]  So I think it's going to be good for maybe a quarter of a bug roll.
[41:13.440 --> 41:17.540]  It's like an emergency single wipe or single session.
[41:18.160 --> 41:20.980]  Have you thought about doing a filing cabinet of bug roll folders?
[41:21.840 --> 41:23.720]  Well, a whole cabinet of just full of them.
[41:24.140 --> 41:24.320]  Yeah.
[41:26.060 --> 41:29.200]  Do you think if you filled a cabinet with bug roll folders,
[41:29.320 --> 41:31.500]  you could only pull from the cabinet for a year?
[41:31.860 --> 41:32.600]  Oh, yeah.
[41:33.100 --> 41:34.220]  You think you can make it a year?
[41:34.660 --> 41:37.280]  How many sessions is one bug roll?
[41:37.640 --> 41:39.640]  I don't know. I think it depends on you.
[41:39.820 --> 41:40.560]  Like 10, maybe?
[41:41.580 --> 41:46.300]  It doesn't come down to how much paper you use per bathroom usage
[41:46.300 --> 41:49.540]  and then how many folders could fit into a cabinet.
[41:49.540 --> 41:53.580]  I feel like this would be a more efficient way to store toilet paper, though.
[41:53.900 --> 41:56.440]  It's not more convenient, but you don't have the air gap.
[42:00.240 --> 42:05.060]  I really like it's more efficient. It's not more convenient.
[42:05.780 --> 42:07.340]  You know, the nice thing about it, too,
[42:07.440 --> 42:11.060]  is a lot of people have magazine racks in their bathroom, you know,
[42:11.120 --> 42:12.960]  or they have like books or magazines for people.
[42:13.160 --> 42:16.200]  You just slap it in there and it's super unassuming, you know?
[42:16.360 --> 42:18.880]  This also sets up for like a wacky sitcom world
[42:18.880 --> 42:21.640]  where you go to your big business meeting and oh, no,
[42:21.680 --> 42:24.800]  you grab the bog roll folder instead of the pitch deck.
[42:24.960 --> 42:27.440]  And somebody's taking a shit with your TBS report.
[42:27.640 --> 42:28.600]  Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[42:28.760 --> 42:31.040]  Someone's wiping printer toner all over their anus.
[42:31.960 --> 42:32.840]  I love it, Gavin.
[42:33.020 --> 42:36.880]  I'd love to see the slimmed down version, the bog slim.
[42:37.500 --> 42:39.940]  Yeah, I'll try and work on a version that will slip under the door.
[42:40.400 --> 42:41.200]  That's a great product.
[42:41.420 --> 42:43.440]  Maybe you can just flatten it more, stomp on it.
[42:43.740 --> 42:44.760]  You got any other lab work?
[42:46.420 --> 42:47.140]  Uh, no.
[42:47.320 --> 42:47.720]  Do you?
[42:49.480 --> 42:50.420]  Funny you should ask.
[42:50.480 --> 42:51.720]  I've also been in the lab.
[42:52.320 --> 42:53.220]  Jeff is in the lab.
[42:53.540 --> 42:54.240]  I was in the lab.
[42:54.360 --> 42:58.500]  Let me, uh, here, let me share my camera with you guys, right?
[42:58.780 --> 42:59.460]  What the fuck?
[42:59.760 --> 43:00.400]  We're getting a camera?
[43:00.500 --> 43:01.980]  Shit, we're in the lab, right?
[43:02.280 --> 43:03.460]  We're truly in the lab.
[43:03.680 --> 43:06.540]  Hang on, is Nick going to record this or what's going on?
[43:07.140 --> 43:07.860]  I mean, I'm with him.
[43:07.940 --> 43:08.740]  Yeah, 100%.
[43:10.120 --> 43:11.260]  Hey, it's Paris.
[43:11.720 --> 43:13.920]  You know, I love sparkly things, right?
[43:13.960 --> 43:14.920]  Like stars.
[43:15.420 --> 43:15.640]  Duh.
[43:16.160 --> 43:17.880]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp,
[43:17.880 --> 43:19.800]  I just slept under them.
[43:20.480 --> 43:24.700]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,
[43:25.160 --> 43:29.400]  making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop.
[43:30.080 --> 43:32.440]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.

[44:11.100 --> 44:13.200]  So I have also been in the lab.
[44:13.340 --> 44:15.260]  Uh, I don't know if you remember, but last week we were,
[44:15.360 --> 44:18.000]  we were talking about the idea of turduckening fruit a little bit.
[44:18.580 --> 44:19.300]  Oh yeah.
[44:19.640 --> 44:23.420]  And so I went to, I went to H-E-B and, which by the way, it got voted.
[44:23.560 --> 44:26.240]  I just read the best grocery store in America in 2014.
[44:26.240 --> 44:26.380]  Really?
[44:27.200 --> 44:27.400]  Good for you.
[44:27.660 --> 44:30.700]  I was going to bring that up on a slightly different subject, uh, down the road.
[44:31.180 --> 44:35.060]  Uh, but, uh, I went ahead and I, I got a bunch of the fruits we discussed and then,
[44:35.220 --> 44:37.940]  uh, some additional fruits and I made some combinations.
[44:37.940 --> 44:40.360]  I don't know which one we should go first with.
[44:40.360 --> 44:42.040]  The only one I remember was, was chapes.
[44:42.660 --> 44:44.900]  Which is what? A cherry and a grape together?
[44:45.280 --> 44:47.640]  I believe that's what that burlesque lady did down the pole.
[44:47.860 --> 44:48.220]  Chapes.
[44:48.460 --> 44:49.880]  I present to you the chape.
[44:50.980 --> 44:53.220]  One half cherry, one half grape.
[44:53.380 --> 44:54.640]  It's, we got a little hat.
[44:54.840 --> 44:57.280]  It looks like Toad from Mario or something.
[44:57.400 --> 44:58.600]  I hollowed that out.
[44:59.780 --> 45:02.280]  Oh, it's got like a little locking system.
[45:02.640 --> 45:02.820]  Yeah.
[45:02.900 --> 45:03.440]  Locked together.
[45:03.940 --> 45:04.780]  Well, then try it and see how it is.
[45:04.860 --> 45:05.180]  I haven't eaten any.
[45:05.200 --> 45:06.120]  Let's review chape.
[45:06.500 --> 45:08.520]  Be careful with the seed in there.
[45:09.900 --> 45:10.940]  He got rid of it.
[45:11.860 --> 45:12.300]  Oh, wow.
[45:12.600 --> 45:13.180]  What's the thought?
[45:13.440 --> 45:13.840]  Interesting.
[45:14.940 --> 45:17.680]  It's almost as if the two flavors cancel each other out.
[45:17.760 --> 45:22.080]  I was gonna say, I bet they're so sweet or so tart that you're kind of getting like,
[45:22.480 --> 45:22.780]  neither.
[45:23.160 --> 45:23.540]  Very big.
[45:23.620 --> 45:24.940]  But I, but I'm not done.
[45:25.420 --> 45:27.280]  There's a lot of things that you can turducken.
[45:27.460 --> 45:32.400]  For instance, what if you hollowed out a grape and stuck blueberries in it?
[45:33.880 --> 45:35.860]  That looks like a tiny cocktail.
[45:35.860 --> 45:42.340]  It's like, oh, that good.
[45:42.960 --> 45:43.680]  That's better.
[45:44.040 --> 45:45.000]  That's the best one yet.
[45:45.460 --> 45:47.080]  OK, but not to be outdone.
[45:47.160 --> 45:50.720]  I've also got a cherry and a grape this way.
[45:50.800 --> 45:51.220]  Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[45:51.260 --> 45:51.800]  This is a cranberry.
[45:51.880 --> 45:52.320]  This is a cranberry.
[45:52.400 --> 45:52.740]  It's not cherry.
[45:52.820 --> 45:54.360]  I think this will be good.
[45:54.440 --> 45:57.580]  There's a, uh, uh, crepe, crepe.
[45:59.080 --> 46:01.860]  But like, there's one is so astringent.
[46:02.040 --> 46:03.380]  And then the other one's a grape.
[46:03.380 --> 46:06.260]  I don't recommend that.
[46:06.520 --> 46:12.340]  OK, if you're listening, Jeff leaned away after he took a bite of that one.
[46:12.780 --> 46:15.040]  Here we have a blueberry cranberry combo.
[46:15.420 --> 46:17.760]  No, it's not going to be any good.
[46:17.800 --> 46:18.780]  Oh, it was so loud.
[46:19.220 --> 46:20.440]  That was a crunch.
[46:20.900 --> 46:21.640]  Not good.
[46:22.080 --> 46:25.020]  I think it's the cranberry that's really making things.
[46:25.120 --> 46:27.280]  Oh, we have a raspberry cranberry.
[46:27.580 --> 46:27.960]  No!
[46:31.060 --> 46:32.560]  Oh, that's going to be a lot.
[46:32.580 --> 46:33.080]  That's not good.
[46:33.720 --> 46:34.540]  That was not.
[46:34.680 --> 46:35.600]  Cranberry is not good.
[46:36.280 --> 46:37.280]  OK, let's try this.
[46:37.400 --> 46:38.960]  Let's get away from grapes for a minute.
[46:39.320 --> 46:41.000]  You don't even have a palate cleanser.
[46:41.080 --> 46:41.490]  How about a...
[46:43.100 --> 46:43.780]  There you go.
[46:44.180 --> 46:44.280]  There!
[46:44.940 --> 46:46.940]  How about a blueberry cherry combo?
[46:47.660 --> 46:48.300]  That's pretty good.
[46:48.300 --> 46:49.120]  I bet that one's good.
[46:49.300 --> 46:50.100]  Yeah, it's probably good.
[46:53.280 --> 46:54.100]  Second best so far.
[46:54.180 --> 46:54.560]  Not the best.
[46:54.720 --> 46:54.980]  OK.
[46:56.160 --> 46:57.780]  Going back to going back to grapes.
[46:59.220 --> 47:00.060]  Just for a minute.
[47:00.700 --> 47:02.640]  These are green grapes for those listening.
[47:03.180 --> 47:03.900]  These are green grapes.
[47:03.900 --> 47:06.340]  I wonder if the red grape was...
[47:06.340 --> 47:08.340]  Video version available on Patreon and YouTube.
[47:09.280 --> 47:10.760]  What about a grape and a strawberry?
[47:11.420 --> 47:13.060]  That looks real dumb.
[47:14.960 --> 47:19.220]  There's something so disturbing about how they're just sat inside each other.
[47:19.340 --> 47:20.480]  Now, that's actually pretty good.
[47:20.940 --> 47:21.640]  Strawberry grape.
[47:21.720 --> 47:23.340]  It might be the best one so far.
[47:23.440 --> 47:24.000]  OK, straight.
[47:24.820 --> 47:26.960]  Then I wanted to move bananas into the mix,
[47:26.980 --> 47:29.940]  and I had this whole idea of hollowing a banana out and filling it with blueberries.
[47:31.260 --> 47:33.960]  But my bananas are too crooked and weren't big enough,
[47:33.960 --> 47:35.420]  so I was only able to make this.
[47:35.600 --> 47:37.340]  A banana with a strawberry hat.
[47:37.540 --> 47:38.000]  Come on.
[47:38.800 --> 47:40.600]  You made a red rocket fruit.
[47:41.640 --> 47:43.220]  That looks like that.
[47:43.460 --> 47:47.740]  That looks like if you uncircumcised the droop snoot.
[47:48.740 --> 47:49.940]  It's a fruit snoot.
[47:52.340 --> 47:54.160]  It's an STD on a droop snoop.
[47:54.500 --> 47:56.780]  I see why people drink banana strawberry.
[47:56.900 --> 47:57.280]  That's good.
[47:57.680 --> 47:58.120]  That's real good.
[47:58.340 --> 47:59.040]  That'd be a good pairing.
[47:59.560 --> 48:01.960]  I'd like to see that with a blueberry on the tip of the strawberry.
[48:04.880 --> 48:05.700]  Then I made...
[48:05.700 --> 48:07.480]  I thought, well, all we're doing is having little finger foods.
[48:07.540 --> 48:08.960]  What if we made an actual sandwich?
[48:09.640 --> 48:14.560]  So what I've done is I took and I made the bread two slices of strawberry,
[48:14.860 --> 48:17.580]  and then on top of it, I sliced as the meat and the cheese.
[48:18.180 --> 48:22.320]  Cherry, grape, cranberry and blueberry.
[48:22.800 --> 48:27.180]  And we'll fold it all together like sort of a fruit Big Mac, as it were.
[48:28.300 --> 48:28.760]  Great.
[48:32.640 --> 48:33.820]  That's just a lot of flavor.
[48:33.960 --> 48:35.900]  Is that like a Hawaiian punch, like a fruit punch?
[48:36.120 --> 48:38.560]  Yeah, there's an explosion of flavors in your mouth.
[48:38.780 --> 48:38.960]  Yeah.
[48:39.080 --> 48:43.180]  And then last but not least, the official, the one that started it all,
[48:43.680 --> 48:48.100]  the cherry to the grape to the raspberry to the blueberry.
[48:48.780 --> 48:50.200]  The full deal.
[48:51.100 --> 48:52.020]  The fruit turducken.
[48:52.380 --> 48:54.880]  That looks like it'd give you extra agility in a shooter.
[48:57.240 --> 48:57.600]  Oh.
[48:58.480 --> 49:00.140]  Oh, he struck. He doesn't like it.
[49:00.160 --> 49:00.460]  No good.
[49:00.560 --> 49:01.080]  Not a fan.
[49:01.100 --> 49:02.040]  By far the worst one.
[49:02.560 --> 49:04.280]  The fruits and pole was the worst one.
[49:04.520 --> 49:05.300]  That was not great.
[49:05.580 --> 49:06.520]  That was not great.
[49:07.620 --> 49:09.160]  So there we have, there's our lab results.
[49:09.260 --> 49:10.480]  Whatever, whatever, whatever.
[49:10.540 --> 49:12.620]  The second thing I had was the best thing.
[49:12.900 --> 49:15.300]  What do you think made that stack at the end not any good?
[49:17.920 --> 49:18.640]  Cranberry didn't.
[49:18.840 --> 49:19.740]  No, there was no cranberry in it.
[49:20.320 --> 49:21.240]  Raspberry didn't help.
[49:21.580 --> 49:21.720]  Yeah.
[49:21.760 --> 49:22.060]  Okay.
[49:22.200 --> 49:22.380]  Yeah.
[49:22.400 --> 49:25.000]  I feel like raspberries are very conflicted with a lot of those other flavors.
[49:25.240 --> 49:26.820]  Oh, I want to get into that.
[49:26.820 --> 49:27.920]  I want to get into the same lab.
[49:28.100 --> 49:29.780]  I might come up with some stuff for next week.
[49:30.080 --> 49:30.760]  You should, you should.
[49:30.840 --> 49:31.380]  It's a lot of fun.
[49:32.120 --> 49:33.160]  You know what else is a lot of fun?
[49:33.720 --> 49:34.940]  Drinking stuff out of a Gerbler.
[49:35.860 --> 49:36.220]  Oh.
[49:36.820 --> 49:37.560]  We got GERP news.
[49:38.420 --> 49:39.420]  Bring on the GERP news.
[49:39.700 --> 49:40.640]  There's some GERP news.
[49:41.940 --> 49:43.140]  Jeff, Eric, do you want to lead?
[49:43.520 --> 49:46.460]  Oh, you're doing, you're doing such a good job right now, Andrew.
[49:46.900 --> 49:47.500]  Yeah, I am.
[49:47.540 --> 49:49.660]  So I'm passing the torch before I fumble it.
[49:49.960 --> 49:51.520]  Thanks for passing the torch to me.
[49:51.740 --> 49:52.840]  I'll pick that torch up.
[49:52.840 --> 49:57.920]  And I'll, I'll, I'll shine it high into the darkness to light the world,
[49:58.040 --> 50:00.600]  to let them know that the GERPLER is coming.
[50:00.980 --> 50:01.700]  Yes, that's right.
[50:01.720 --> 50:03.000]  The month of February.
[50:03.260 --> 50:04.940]  There will be additional GERPLERS.
[50:05.120 --> 50:06.300]  Hold on, let me hold the light.
[50:06.540 --> 50:10.660]  I'm going to shine it a little bit higher so we can get a few more people in the back and see.
[50:10.800 --> 50:13.260]  Can you see the date?
[50:13.340 --> 50:13.780]  It's right there.
[50:13.840 --> 50:16.300]  It's February, but it's two digits.
[50:16.500 --> 50:16.800]  That's right.
[50:16.840 --> 50:17.380]  You can see the date.
[50:17.440 --> 50:18.140]  It's definitely two digits.
[50:18.180 --> 50:19.100]  First digit's a one.
[50:19.480 --> 50:20.200]  First digit's a one.
[50:20.200 --> 50:22.120]  It's going to be easy to figure out the second because they're only,
[50:22.760 --> 50:25.380]  you're going to get some sticks on it, except there's going to be a range.
[50:26.700 --> 50:27.580]  February 14th.
[50:27.660 --> 50:30.500]  February 14th, the GERPLER will launch.
[50:30.600 --> 50:33.000]  It's happy GERPLERtine's Day.
[50:33.240 --> 50:33.660]  Relaunch.
[50:34.200 --> 50:42.720]  Our gift to you is a shot at one of 5,000 GERPLERS that will be launching at noon on February 14th.
[50:42.740 --> 50:43.200]  That's right.
[50:43.520 --> 50:45.660]  Valentine's Day is now GERPLERtine's Day.
[50:45.880 --> 50:47.320]  We are co-opting the holiday.
[50:47.600 --> 50:48.860]  We are taking it over.
[50:48.860 --> 50:51.360]  Don Valentine better come and talk to me.
[50:51.440 --> 50:52.360]  I'll set him straight.
[50:52.480 --> 50:54.280]  It's our day now, motherfuckers.
[50:54.800 --> 50:57.920]  Celebrate GERPLERtine's Day with us.
[50:58.160 --> 51:03.340]  We're going to be playing Mario Party Jamboree, I believe, over on the Twitch stream.
[51:03.340 --> 51:03.460]  We're doing it again.
[51:03.780 --> 51:07.260]  Celebrating the launch of GERPLERtine's Day.
[51:07.640 --> 51:09.600]  Now to take it back to where this all begun.
[51:09.760 --> 51:14.500]  Obviously, we sold our first black GERPLER and we ordered more of those than any other
[51:14.500 --> 51:18.580]  we've had before, and they sold out instantly to our surprise.
[51:18.900 --> 51:21.080]  People were understandably, I really want one.
[51:21.160 --> 51:21.720]  That's disappointing.
[51:21.900 --> 51:27.320]  So we immediately ordered 5,000 more, and the hope is that everyone that wanted one
[51:27.320 --> 51:28.180]  will now be able to get one.
[51:28.740 --> 51:31.520]  We've been waiting ever since that last stream to get these.
[51:31.580 --> 51:32.640]  They're finally arriving.
[51:32.740 --> 51:36.560]  It takes a while for them to be made and then shipped and then get everything all worked
[51:36.560 --> 51:40.660]  out, but they are going to be here February 14th and we're streaming it.
[51:41.060 --> 51:44.680]  And if for some reason they sell out, we will buy more.
[51:44.980 --> 51:45.940]  There's no way, surely?
[51:46.900 --> 51:48.240]  There's, I mean, zero chance.
[51:48.360 --> 51:49.480]  Can't we just do a different?
[51:49.540 --> 51:50.780]  Can we do a different GERPLER?
[51:51.060 --> 51:52.020]  Do we have to do the same one?
[51:52.020 --> 51:52.900]  We can do a different GERPLER.
[51:53.000 --> 51:53.740]  Okay, let's just say this.
[51:53.740 --> 51:54.980]  This is it for this GERPLER.
[51:55.180 --> 51:57.440]  9,000 of this design is enough.
[51:57.700 --> 52:00.800]  Maybe, who knows, we reserve the right to bring back old styles, blah, blah, blah.
[52:00.940 --> 52:02.440]  I want to move on to a different look.
[52:02.480 --> 52:03.940]  I think we've had so many cool ideas.
[52:04.040 --> 52:05.380]  I want to move on to a different look of GERPLERs.
[52:05.380 --> 52:09.460]  I want to see what kind of GERPLER a guy like GERPLJOE would drink out of.
[52:09.460 --> 52:10.700]  He seems like it.
[52:10.700 --> 52:11.280]  Who's GERPLJOE?
[52:11.360 --> 52:13.420]  A mysterious figure, that's for sure.
[52:14.660 --> 52:15.840]  Have you seen GERPLER?
[52:15.840 --> 52:16.520]  Have we seen?
[52:16.760 --> 52:17.220]  Where's GERPLER?
[52:17.520 --> 52:19.240]  I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[52:19.440 --> 52:24.780]  Anyway, it'll be out at noon on regulationstore.com.
[52:24.860 --> 52:28.680]  It'll be noon central, but we'll be live on twitch.tv slash the regulation pod
[52:28.680 --> 52:31.860]  a little before noon to celebrate the launch and then playing.
[52:32.100 --> 52:34.540]  What was the, what did Jeff keep calling Mario Party?
[52:35.220 --> 52:36.040]  Mario Party Jubilee.
[52:36.560 --> 52:37.000]  Jubilee!
[52:37.380 --> 52:37.820]  Jubilee!
[52:37.820 --> 52:39.960]  He kept calling it Mario Party Jubilee.
[52:40.600 --> 52:44.840]  I think it'd be sick if we actually had some GERPLERs left in the store
[52:44.840 --> 52:45.980]  after that stream.
[52:46.400 --> 52:47.160]  It'd be amazing.
[52:47.920 --> 52:50.160]  Now, are you saying sick good or sick bad?
[52:50.300 --> 52:52.360]  Because depending on the community, sick good could be good.
[52:52.360 --> 52:52.860]  That's true.
[52:53.120 --> 52:55.300]  Are we talking poker terms or what?
[52:55.340 --> 52:55.840]  All in.
[52:56.300 --> 52:57.820]  That was so sick, Gavin.
[52:59.960 --> 53:02.220]  Uh, I'm excited about these.
[53:02.280 --> 53:06.800]  I'm excited about the next GERPLERs that we're doing and some more merch that we have coming
[53:06.800 --> 53:09.120]  probably around May.
[53:09.640 --> 53:10.660]  May, yeah.
[53:10.920 --> 53:18.880]  A new, uh, a new revolutionary shirt and, um, some things that you can wave high and
[53:18.880 --> 53:19.140]  proud.
[53:19.260 --> 53:19.700]  But we'll see.
[53:19.800 --> 53:20.740]  That, that's for future.
[53:20.840 --> 53:28.560]  But for right now, Valentine's Day, GERPL, GER, GERPL, I can't, GERPLTINES, GERPLTINES
[53:28.560 --> 53:31.220]  Day, February 14th at noon central.
[53:32.020 --> 53:34.320]  Will you be our GERPLTINE?
[53:35.040 --> 53:36.880]  Like a giant black cup.
[53:37.620 --> 53:40.180]  I told, I told you we could go with a second idea.
[53:40.280 --> 53:41.760]  Didn't have to be that still.
[53:41.860 --> 53:42.140]  I just.
[53:42.220 --> 53:43.960]  What are some of the other hearts say?
[53:44.540 --> 53:48.340]  GERPL, GERPL heart, uh, well, not GERPL hearts, Valentine's hearts.
[53:48.460 --> 53:49.740]  Be mine, be mine.
[53:50.040 --> 53:50.520]  Be hearts.
[53:51.000 --> 53:51.440]  Be my GERPL.
[53:51.560 --> 53:52.120]  Let's see.
[53:52.200 --> 53:53.720]  Let's workshop this right now.
[53:53.800 --> 53:54.060]  Okay.
[53:54.400 --> 53:55.320]  GERPL me, baby.
[53:56.480 --> 53:58.040]  You're, you're GERPL.
[53:58.580 --> 54:01.360]  Uh, GERPL pie, GER, GERPLER pie.
[54:01.960 --> 54:04.260]  Uh, GERPIES, not herpes.
[54:06.400 --> 54:09.020]  Uh, love, uh, GERP, GERP ya.
[54:10.100 --> 54:11.120]  Lil, Lil GERP ya.
[54:12.640 --> 54:13.400]  GERP me.
[54:14.840 --> 54:16.640]  I don't like when he says that.
[54:16.840 --> 54:18.160]  I don't like the way he says it.
[54:18.220 --> 54:19.840]  I don't like what it's, I don't like it.
[54:21.000 --> 54:22.400]  Uh, be mine.
[54:22.560 --> 54:25.540]  And then you can flip it on the other side and it says GERPLER.
[54:25.800 --> 54:27.760]  Oh, double sided heart.
[54:28.280 --> 54:30.100]  Because most hearts have two sides.
[54:30.480 --> 54:33.520]  So are we just going to photoshop a little GERPL love heart banner thing?
[54:34.340 --> 54:34.620]  Sure.
[54:34.860 --> 54:35.240]  I don't know.
[54:35.640 --> 54:36.540]  Are you, I don't know.
[54:37.080 --> 54:37.280]  Sure.
[54:37.300 --> 54:38.280]  Are you just reading them all out?
[54:38.340 --> 54:39.360]  Like we're going to use this somewhere.
[54:39.780 --> 54:43.160]  No, I just go, I was curious what they, I was trying to figure out what the best variation
[54:43.160 --> 54:43.480]  would be.
[54:43.520 --> 54:43.860]  It's tough.
[54:43.940 --> 54:44.960]  There's not a lot of natural.
[54:46.160 --> 54:48.320]  Bunch of X's and O's on it.
[54:48.340 --> 54:49.540]  I don't know how we, yeah, no.
[54:50.640 --> 54:51.100]  What did you say?
[54:51.160 --> 54:51.740]  GERPL times?
[54:51.840 --> 54:52.460]  Let's go with that.
[54:52.560 --> 54:53.220]  That was the, that was.
[54:54.100 --> 54:55.580]  It's a, Eric was pretty insistent.
[54:55.640 --> 54:57.940]  We use GERPL time and I want to stick to his initial vision.
[54:58.100 --> 54:59.860]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[55:00.100 --> 55:01.800]  He's the one that coined the phrase.
[55:02.320 --> 55:02.680]  Unfortunately.
[55:02.960 --> 55:04.140]  And then I said, that's the first idea.
[55:04.180 --> 55:05.140]  Let's find a better idea.
[55:05.260 --> 55:06.800]  And then I guess Andrew went through about 12.
[55:06.920 --> 55:08.660]  So maybe GERPL times days about it.
[55:08.660 --> 55:08.820]  Yeah.
[55:08.820 --> 55:09.600]  I confirmed that.
[55:11.160 --> 55:13.080]  The worst idea turned out to be the best.
[55:13.200 --> 55:13.460]  Yeah.
[55:14.580 --> 55:15.980]  It's usually how it goes with this show, but.
[55:16.320 --> 55:21.960]  I realized the other day that the, a lot of the regulation audience views my career as
[55:21.960 --> 55:27.260]  being in a much different phase than it used to be because we put out the agility tube video
[55:27.820 --> 55:29.260]  for, what was that for box standard?
[55:29.660 --> 55:30.020]  Yes.
[55:30.240 --> 55:30.460]  Yeah.
[55:30.620 --> 55:30.760]  Yeah.
[55:30.860 --> 55:31.040]  Sorry.
[55:31.160 --> 55:31.860]  Box standard.
[55:31.980 --> 55:34.220]  And, uh, people, people seem to really like it.
[55:34.240 --> 55:34.740]  Like the video.
[55:35.480 --> 55:36.900]  It's just a lot of comments on it.
[55:36.920 --> 55:40.640]  It's where people are like, guys, at your age, you should really be warming up first.
[55:40.860 --> 55:41.980]  You should really be stretching.
[55:44.600 --> 55:46.340]  And I've never had those comments before.
[55:46.660 --> 55:46.920]  Yep.
[55:47.260 --> 55:47.860]  It's true.
[55:48.220 --> 55:50.080]  I was in so much pain after that.
[55:50.380 --> 55:52.440]  It was for, sorry, uh, just a correction.
[55:52.560 --> 55:54.580]  It was for extra medium and above it's on Patreon.
[55:54.720 --> 55:55.720]  You can watch it over there.
[55:55.720 --> 55:56.440]  And you're right.
[55:56.480 --> 56:01.840]  Because the thing that when I rewatched it, when you get halfway through that tube and you're like,
[56:02.320 --> 56:03.620]  you're not even like yelling.
[56:03.620 --> 56:05.120]  You're like howling.
[56:06.940 --> 56:08.640]  Like, it's not good.
[56:08.720 --> 56:12.260]  It's like very hurt by what you're going through.
[56:13.000 --> 56:18.180]  It looks like one of those, uh, beat up tube things you'd have at school that you'd make
[56:18.180 --> 56:19.620]  with what, what was that called?
[56:19.760 --> 56:22.220]  Like you would beat up tube.
[56:22.360 --> 56:23.280]  It wasn't a tube.
[56:23.360 --> 56:25.020]  It was people like you'd have like.
[56:25.020 --> 56:28.540]  20 people, like 10 people on each side, and they'd be holding arms.
[56:28.780 --> 56:34.420]  And then people have to run under through the tunnel while, while everyone's kicking you.
[56:34.460 --> 56:34.760]  Did you not?
[56:35.140 --> 56:35.460]  What?
[56:35.760 --> 56:36.380]  Did you not play that?
[56:36.980 --> 56:40.940]  That sounds like you're getting, that sounds like you're getting jumped into a gang, dude.
[56:41.360 --> 56:44.720]  Keep explaining how you got initiated into your violence gang, please.
[56:45.420 --> 56:47.540]  And you'd come out all kicked and bruised.
[56:48.120 --> 56:48.640]  Are you okay?
[56:48.900 --> 56:52.740]  And then everybody hugs you and they say you're a member of the family for life.
[56:53.320 --> 56:54.080]  Something like that.
[56:54.080 --> 56:54.660]  Yeah.
[56:54.820 --> 56:55.580]  Vatos Locos.
[56:55.700 --> 56:55.840]  Yeah.
[56:56.500 --> 56:58.500]  Uh, what was the name of this?
[56:59.300 --> 56:59.960]  Chicago Shootout.
[57:00.140 --> 57:00.460]  Okay.
[57:00.920 --> 57:03.420]  Don't bring up Chicago Shootout.
[57:03.800 --> 57:08.600]  My, my wife's friend was like, oh yeah, Chicago Shootout.
[57:08.660 --> 57:09.360]  I remember that.
[57:09.420 --> 57:11.040]  And I think my wife paid her off.
[57:11.140 --> 57:11.660]  I don't think.
[57:12.000 --> 57:12.460]  A hundred percent.
[57:12.620 --> 57:12.800]  Yeah.
[57:12.860 --> 57:13.020]  I think.
[57:13.200 --> 57:14.020]  Yeah, that's a load of bollocks.
[57:14.320 --> 57:15.540]  Michaela, I don't believe you.
[57:15.860 --> 57:16.560]  I'm just letting you know.
[57:17.080 --> 57:19.780]  I don't remember what that game was called or whether it had a name.
[57:20.320 --> 57:21.340]  I remember how it felt.
[57:21.340 --> 57:27.480]  But if there's anyone in the, in the audience who also played Run Through the Hurt Tunnel.
[57:29.560 --> 57:34.060]  But anyway, that's what it, that's what I sounded like when I went through the agility shoot.
[57:34.360 --> 57:36.720]  We used to play Red Rover when we were kids.
[57:36.760 --> 57:38.580]  It sounds like you played Red Dead Rover.
[57:38.860 --> 57:39.100]  Yeah.
[57:40.380 --> 57:41.980]  Red Rover was violent too, wasn't it?
[57:42.000 --> 57:43.600]  You get people like clothesline and stuff.
[57:43.760 --> 57:44.440]  Yeah, of course.
[57:45.800 --> 57:49.680]  Be remiss if we didn't bring it up, but we, we're getting on towards time.
[57:49.680 --> 57:53.440]  So I do want to hit it now that we've covered sort of like Gerpler stuff and everything.
[57:53.500 --> 57:54.940]  Do you guys squinkle or what?
[57:55.920 --> 57:57.200]  Oh yeah, I got my squinks.
[57:57.360 --> 57:58.160]  Oh, we got squinks.
[57:58.360 --> 57:58.800]  Squink em boys.
[57:59.080 --> 57:59.480]  Squinks.
[58:00.240 --> 58:01.580]  So this all started.
[58:01.740 --> 58:01.940]  Squinkles.
[58:02.680 --> 58:07.060]  Because we saw the squinkles chunks at that airport in Cancun.
[58:07.520 --> 58:11.960]  I went to the Hispanic grocery store by, down the road.
[58:12.840 --> 58:15.380]  Just to see if I could get squinkles chunks.
[58:15.560 --> 58:18.740]  But they had the exact same squinkles offering as HEB.
[58:18.740 --> 58:19.980]  Once again, why HEB is the best.
[58:20.300 --> 58:22.160]  So I have here Luca's Squinklote.
[58:22.440 --> 58:24.380]  And then I have Squinkles Salsa Getty.
[58:24.720 --> 58:27.180]  I got Squinkles Salsa Getty.
[58:27.220 --> 58:27.900]  What did you get, Gavin?
[58:28.600 --> 58:29.580]  I have no squinkles.
[58:30.320 --> 58:30.680]  What?
[58:31.720 --> 58:33.400]  Okay, so we have to not squink.
[58:33.860 --> 58:35.220]  All right, we'll have to wait to squink with Gavin.
[58:35.380 --> 58:36.220]  Holding off on the squink?
[58:36.400 --> 58:39.040]  Yep, we will, we will, we will have to future squink.
[58:39.100 --> 58:39.360]  Sorry.
[58:39.940 --> 58:41.140]  Nah, you can squink and then I'll squink.
[58:41.360 --> 58:43.180]  Maybe I'll combine some squinks with some fruit.
[58:44.020 --> 58:45.440]  I think we do a big squink together.
[58:45.940 --> 58:46.460]  We already did.
[58:46.520 --> 58:48.520]  We already had two lab sessions in this episode.
[58:48.520 --> 58:49.300]  We can squink later.
[58:50.520 --> 58:53.880]  Oh, speaking of stuff related to this podcast.
[58:55.540 --> 58:56.800]  Hey, speaking of stuff.
[58:57.340 --> 59:00.780]  I owe you guys, Eric and Andrew, vinyls.
[59:00.900 --> 59:03.060]  I don't remember why, but it's in my notes that I owed you both vinyls.
[59:03.140 --> 59:04.840]  So Andrew, I mailed you a vinyl yesterday.
[59:04.980 --> 59:06.120]  And Eric, I bought you one.
[59:06.240 --> 59:06.860]  It's in my house.
[59:06.960 --> 59:08.000]  I'll give it to you next time I see you.
[59:08.040 --> 59:08.560]  I'll give it to you tomorrow.
[59:09.700 --> 59:10.100]  Yeah, yeah.
[59:10.340 --> 59:10.560]  Easy.
[59:11.120 --> 59:11.320]  Cool.
[59:11.620 --> 59:12.100]  I'm excited.
[59:13.540 --> 59:16.900]  Another thing that I'm excited about actually is the falcon tier thing.
[59:16.900 --> 59:21.340]  The time of this recording, a little bit later today, we're doing a falcon tier watch along
[59:21.340 --> 59:22.940]  that finally pays off.
[59:24.060 --> 59:27.180]  Yeah, we are doing a mouse hunt watch along.
[59:27.420 --> 59:29.940]  If you become a falcon, you'll be able to watch it later.
[59:30.040 --> 59:31.240]  At the time this is coming out.
[59:31.320 --> 59:32.180]  You've missed it by a week.
[59:32.260 --> 59:35.940]  Sorry, but you'll be able to watch it later over on Patreon.
[59:36.400 --> 59:39.740]  So Andrew had all the rest of the four of us pick a movie.
[59:39.960 --> 59:40.260]  Is that right?
[59:40.260 --> 59:41.400]  And then what happened?
[59:41.800 --> 59:43.060]  Then the falcons voted.
[59:43.540 --> 59:43.940]  Yep.
[59:44.700 --> 59:45.740]  And they picked a mouse hunt.
[59:45.740 --> 59:49.000]  The second most popular was Snake Eyes.
[59:49.280 --> 59:50.180]  Of course it was.
[59:50.280 --> 59:51.420]  I couldn't believe it lost.
[59:51.780 --> 59:52.840]  Like when you said mouse hunt?
[59:53.280 --> 59:53.300]  Crazy.
[59:54.260 --> 59:58.880]  So I'm going to go in order of what I think the spirit of.
[59:59.320 --> 01:00:05.520]  Because I went with Blast, the Eddie Griffin Breckenmeyer action movie that I thought was
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.340]  very cool.
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.940]  Yeah, makes sense.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:11.200]  Then Eric went with Snake Eyes.
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:12.900]  Makes sense.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.400]  I think also kind of related to the show as bit.
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.080]  Gavin went with Mouse Hunt.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:19.860]  That was your pick.
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.040]  That was a great movie.
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:24.100]  Jeff went with Super Futs, I believe.
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:25.460]  Also makes sense.
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:28.500]  I've mentioned it a few times around the time we picked Condor Man.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.920]  That was the other movie I wanted to pick.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.980]  I'm still going to make you guys watch it at some point.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.860]  And Nick went with Air Force One.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:36.800]  Air Force One?
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:39.160]  Nick's like, I just want to watch Air Force One.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:39.880]  Yeah.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.000]  When have we talked about Air Force One?
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.440]  Nick is a huge Air Force One fan.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.600]  I draft it all the time.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.200]  You draft it all the time?
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.320]  You've drafted it twice?
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:51.760]  It was in a draft and then the ranker.
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:55.620]  Like we're all kind of picking like campy, like kind of group watch movies.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.740]  And I just love that Nick's just like, nah, Air Force One.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.700]  Let's get everybody together.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.680]  Let's watch Air Force One.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.100]  You asked me what movie I wanted to watch with the focus.
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:03.000]  Yeah, I know.
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:03.540]  I love it.
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:04.780]  I think it's a great pick.
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.000]  So which one do you want to watch?
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.980]  Which one was least voted for?
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:08.620]  Blast.
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:09.280]  My pick.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.480]  Eddie Griffin, Brick and Wire.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.220]  Blast had the lowest percentage of votes.
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:13.860]  How about that?
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:15.240]  That's crazy.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.220]  I just don't realize.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.440]  Talked about the longest to go of all of them.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.300]  That's, you know what?
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.560]  I would argue it would be one of the most fun watches that we could do.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.500]  They're playing soccer in the hood now and he bicycle kicks a grenade.
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:27.100]  It's great.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.740]  Also, just the embarrassment.
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:35.400]  There is an action scene in it that I watched later in life that I remember as a child watching
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.700]  it going, that was so fucking cool.
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:43.180]  And then watching it as an adult going, it's maybe the most embarrassed I've ever been about
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:43.520]  anything.
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:44.900]  That was a terrible scene.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.900]  I think that's the kind of context the audience needs before casting a vote.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:54.380]  It's like we all need 20 seconds to prevent to present our choice.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.420]  I gave a little bit of context on each pick.
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.660]  That's but that's like, whoa.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.040]  But that's tough because I agree with you, Gavin.
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.140]  But I also think that that's going to sway.
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:06.840]  Did you did you say who picked what?
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.840]  I don't think I said maybe.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:10.460]  I don't remember.
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:16.500]  But I definitely put flavor in for all the picks of why this is why I think us because
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.280]  I want to make an effort of like, here's why we should watch it.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.340]  And we each do it like a little 20 second blurb.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.880]  But then I think people won't vote for the movie.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.540]  They'll vote for the person who picked it.
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:32.580]  And and and I think I think voting for the movie, there's a spirit to this thing, Gavin.
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:37.980]  And I think that's why we just think if you present your movie, no one will pick it.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:43.200]  I think they'll look at me picking a movie versus you picking a movie and pick the movie
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.280]  that you picked versus the movie that I picked.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.180]  Yes. Do I think that?
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.980]  Yeah, I know that. Absolutely.
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:55.740]  OK, well, OK, what if you still don't know who picked what and one person
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.920]  delivers all of the reasoning and context behind the picks?
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.320]  Sure. I mean, yeah, yeah, we can do that.
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.740]  I don't think there's a problem with that.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.880]  I just don't know. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.540]  You know, it's great. Anonymous, I think, is very important.
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:11.500]  Look at this poster. V for Vendetta.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:17.680]  An uncompromising vision of the future from the creators of the Matrix trilogy.
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:19.660]  Right. Of course.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.780]  I gotta see this movie. Is it good?
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.520]  I don't think so. I don't think it was. I have zero memory.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.280]  No, it sucked.
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:30.500]  I think it's like 2008 good. You know what I mean?
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.880]  Like, it's like it wasn't, though. It was sucked.
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:35.940]  What a shame.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:40.680]  73% on Rotten Tomatoes. A lot higher. 8.1 on IMDb.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.780]  People seem to like it. Stupid hat. Stupid movie.
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.720]  It was all it was just like a JVC ad. Everything was like a JVC computer or TV.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.720]  Heavy product placement throughout the whole fucking film.
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:53.120]  Yeah, that's what I remember about it.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.820]  Oh, I love that clip of David Lynch talking about product placement in movies.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.520]  It's so funny.
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:07.980]  So, is Grinch part of the Minions universe?
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.840]  No, but I was explaining why it makes sense that I affiliate V for Vendetta with the Matrix.
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:15.900]  Affiliate or associate?
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.640]  You know, I think you can pick. It's, you know, we live in a free country.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:26.740]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, he's wrong either way. So whichever way you want to ascribe that, go for it.
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:30.860]  Well, an affiliate is what you get on Twitch.
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:33.700]  You start as an affiliate.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.980]  I'm a partner, so I wouldn't know anything about that.
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.760]  Fucking brag about it.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.040]  Yeah, that's what I was just doing.
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:48.660]  An associate is someone who sells you something. Like a sales associate.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:53.240]  That is something. That's one of the definitions of associate.
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:57.460]  Associate is that word. Associate is a different word.
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:01.300]  And what does that spell?
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.120]  Thanks for listening, everybody.
[01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:12.190]  I was just about to say we should wrap up, and I think you're doing a great job, Jeff.
[01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:19.090]  We did it. We finished the whole goddamn episode, and we did it right here in front of you. And you
[01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:23.770]  watched the whole fucking thing unwind. Because let's be honest, Nick's not doing too much heavy
[01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:27.450]  editing here. He leaves a lot of the pauses in. Dennis is the one that makes them snappier.
[01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:34.090]  That's what I learned last week from Gavin. Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.
[01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.930]  Love you.
[01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:37.930]  Love you, Dennis. Bye!
[01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:39.590]  Hey, what the fuck?
